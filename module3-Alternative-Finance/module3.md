#### Module 3 Alternative Finance   3.1 Module 3 Introduction   Video 3.1 Module 3 Introduction

Alternative Finance,
can broadly be described as
comprising financial channels and instruments
that emerge outside the traditional financial system.

In my chapter in The Fintech Book,
which has recently been translated
and published in China,
I have called some of these emerging
financial channels, online capital marketplaces.


Alternative finance can also refer
to the new investment classes
being sought to be created,
including equity and loans to SMEs,
and more recently, crypto assets.

In this module, we will discuss the following:
* A brief history of finance and its innovations.
* The digitization of financial services.
* The opportunities and challenges of distributed peer-to-peer models of finance, such as crowdfunding, marketplace lending and token sales.
* The rise of the Chinese TechFins in its new models and products.
* How the banks are now positioning themselves as technology companies.

Finance can and should be
an enabler of commerce and investment
in growing the real economy
as well as to provide individuals
with more personal security
against life's vicissitudes.

Money or currency consists of
a stored value instrument that is scarce.
Throughout the ages,
these have ranged from cowry shells
to gold and minted metal coinage.
In the west,
money lenders have existed since the Roman Empire
where individuals have made
private loans to those who needed it.
There has long been widespread
religious and moral condemnation against usury.

The charging of interest for loans
with different religions taking different stances
on the permissible extent of such interest.
For example, the Islamic faith prohibits
any charging of interest whereas
the Judaic faith permits charging interest to non-Jews.


Modern legislation focuses more on setting limits
on the amount of permissible interest set.

Florence sat at the centre of the Renaissance
due in part to the extensive trade
through the Italian city
leading to over 100 banks being there
by the end of the 14th Century.

The Medici banking empire
was one such example
and was the banker for the Catholic Church.
Its expansion was aided by the invention
of double-entry bookkeeping by
Franciscan friar, Luca Pacioli
which allowed for reliable documentation
for both creditor and debtor.

The Tang and Song Dynasty emperors
in the seventh century started using paper
which their forefathers in China invented
as bank notes or jiaozi,
that were originally used as promissory notes
and became a lightweight alternative
to heavy and metallic coinage.

To address counterfeiting,
a variety of techniques involving different inks,
papers and seals were used.

Property and being able to prove ownership
is critical as sources of collateral for finance.
Pawn shops such as the medieval practise
of so-called Lombard banking
dealt in the delivery of goods and custody
and many legal jurisdictions developed
centralised land record registries
that enabled more lending to take place.

As international trade grew,
the financing of those ocean expeditions
of vast durations and distances
involved substantial risk.
With the invention of the joint stock company
shares and bonds could be
issued to the general public to fund projects
and the Dutch East India Company
listing in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange
paved the way in the 17th Century.

Similar venues were set up across the ocean
at coffee shops along London's exchange alley,
and under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street,
and sea captains and merchants also met
at Lloyd's Coffee House at London's Tower Street.
These soon evolved into powerful institutions,
today's London Stock Exchange,
New York Stock Exchange
and Lloyd's of London

Within these buildings,
trading runners or deer would dash to
nearby brokerage offices
to deliver stock quotes
from the brokers on the exchange floor.
With the invention of electricity,
technologies like the telegraph
and then the telephone soon meant
proximity to the exchanges proved less critical.

In 1971, Nasdaq became the first electronic exchange
with many other securities and
commodities exchanges following suit.
A new electronic and digital era was dawning.

#### Module 3 Alternative Finance   3.3 Digitization of Financial Services   Video 3.3 Digitization of Financial Services


**Financial investment** and trading
can best be understood as
comprising of two groups.

First, **retail investment and trading
of public companies** is conducted
by the general public on exchanges
through brokers and dealers.

Second, **institutional investment and trading**
involves large financial institutions
who buy and sell publicly listed securities
between each other.

In the meantime,
the investment into private companies
has been the remit of specialised investors,
such as venture capital and private equity firms,
with so called exit or liquidity events
being an initial public offering
into the public markets
or trade sale of the business.

The venture capital firms
on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California,
were likely instrumental in investing and growing
what become known as Silicon Valley.
Including their successes in hardware
being turned into software and the internet
that gave rise to the dot com boom.

One major development at that time
was when online brokerage firm E*Trade
was able to get allocations
to some of the hot tech IPOs.

Electronic banking also started expanding
as major banks extended services to consumers
who were increasingly coming online
with the lowering costs
and increasing ease of access.

At the same time,
institutional trading expanded dramatically,
with alternative trading systems and **dark pools**
allowing financial institutions to trade
large blocks of securities at one time
to minimise pricing impact.

At the same time,
proprietary trading at desks invested and develop
**automated algorithmic trading programmes**,
as well as high frequency trading programmes
that use computational power
to devise trading strategies
and automate trading in ways no human could.

The global financial crisis in 2007
changed the landscape dramatically.
After the bursting of the sub prime mortgage bubble,
and the rapid devaluation of financial instruments,
such as mortgage backed securities
and credit default swaps,
many major financial institutions collapsed,
or needed to be bailed out by their governments.

Lending then dried up by many traditional lenders,
and many governments sought to encourage
the emergence of new players and business models
that provided alternative finance
to individuals and businesses.

At the same time,
**2010's flash crash**
saw the Dow Jones Index drop
nine percent within minutes
and was subsequently attributed
to high frequency traders initialling,
spoofing algorithms
that placed thousands of orders
with intention of cancelling them.
The automatic shutting down
of many automated computerised traders
due to the extreme drop
also led to a rapid loss of liquidity.

In the European Union,
challenger banks were encouraged
and has culminated
in open banking policies such as
the payment services directive,
which forces banks to produce customer data
to make it **easier for customers
to switch financial providers**.
Some of these banks were also virtual banks,
with no branches at all.

In the United States,
a stark reminder that
it was not business as usual
can be seen in the before and after pictures
of UBS's famed trading floor in Stanford, Connecticut.
This was once the largest in the world
with 5,000 stock, bond and currency traders.

The global financial crisis resulted,
amongst other things,
in the passing of **Dodd-Frank**,
which prohibited proprietary trading by banks,
and the **Jump Start Our Business Startups Act**,
or JOBS Act in 2012,
which legitimised the concept
of equity crowdfunding in law.
The era of distributed peer-to-peer models
of finance was born.

#### Module 3 Alternative Finance   3.4 FinTech & Funds   Video 3.4 FinTech and Funds

As we all know, FinTech is really disrupting
many verticals of the financial services industry,
from investment banking,
asset management, retail banking.
But one area that it's also affecting as well
is the hedge fund industry.

For many years, the hedge fund industry
was the most entrepreneurial,
at the cutting edge of technology.
And obviously, a lot of Fintech innovations
are benefiting the broader hedge fund industry as well.

There's many examples.
Think about it.
Imagine I'm a fund manager.
Normally I try to access data
that is available publicly
and I'm trying to use.
But what if I can use some of the big data analytics
and artificial intelligence solutions
to try to really generate insights?

Imagine using satellite imagery to try to look at
what's happening on, let's say, on oil containers
and how much oil there are on the ships.

Or actually looking from satellite imagery
how many cars are in the parking lot
and use that to try to actually forecast
a company's actually earnings.

Or imagine being able to use
some of the latest technology to read,
go through all the news articles
around the world available online
or all the tweets and Facebook messages
and be able to come up with a sentiment analysis
of what are people really seeing
and thinking around the world

today a lot of people
want to get access to research.
A normal hedge fund manager would actually try
to work with an investment bank,
will actually execute some of their traits
via an investment bank to get access
to some of their research analysts.
But if you think about it,
it's not very efficient.
It's a bit like buying a CD if you like one song.

What now we're seeing the emergence
of independent platforms.
If you think about the Spotify of research
where investment analysts can actually go there,
put your own research.
And if customers like them,
they just go pay for the research and pay
for that specific investment analyst.

FinTech is affecting the way business is done.
Today, anybody launches a hedge fund or a fund,
will generally try to go raise money from investors.
That service is now offered by investment banks
who will try to match hedge fund managers
and hedge fund investors.
The way that process works is very inefficient.
Often via conferences and
personal meetings or emails,
it's actually not very efficient.
We are now seeing the emergence of online platforms
where these two branches can actually connect.
And actually you have analytics
and data on who can be a good fit for each other.

### Industry Showcase: How AI is Transforming the Future of FinTech (Microsoft)

how AI technologies
and big data analytics could integrate
with your FinTech technologies.

Smarter computers, algorithms,
and dedicated AI systems
enable smarter decision-making,
deeper learning.

And the combination of artificial intelligence
and big data,
allow us to understand better how people,
how they spend the money, their health,
as well as the lifestyle.

For example, intelligent banking.
It is all based on the "always on" customer,
and predicting his or her financial needs
at a certain point of time.

Thus, it's not just about the bank,
but providing products and services
through one channel,
a single interface that can maximise
your customer experience,
and hence centricity.

However, building those trusts from your customers
is still one of the biggest challenges for FinTech.
And in Microsoft, we are trying our best
to gain and build lots and lots of trust
from our customers.
And here are a few examples:

**If P&C Insurance** is a world-leading
property and casualty insurance company
that serves over 3 millions of customers
in the Nordic region:

* **if** actually leveraging our Cortana Analytics Suite
to perform Churn analytics.
In other words, predicting whether their customers
will cancel the policy in a 40-day window
surrounding the renewal dates.

* they're doing upsell prediction.
Basically, finding the probability of success
of upsell communication to a given customer.

* they are applying text analytics algorithms
on their inbound emails from their customers.
So, they could now better understand their customers,
classify those emails,
and better serve their customers.


Another example is **Novum Bank**.
Novum Bank will like to
assess the credit-worthiness of their customers.

Especially in the poor credit information markets.
With Microsoft, they actually built
an automated psychographic credit-scoring engine,
running on Azure, for onboarding.
In return, the acceptance rate was increased by 18%,
and they actually rejected
bad customers formerly accepted.

**CallCredit**, one of the UK's largest
credit reference agencies.
They're actually leveraging Azure machine learning
to identify criminals who pretend people
to access credit reports, and borrow money.
With all these machine learning and AI tools,
CallCredit can now proactively spot people
who will actually fail to pay back their loans.

#### Module 3 Alternative Finance   Industry Showcase: Ensuring Compliance from the Start: Suitability and Funds (Investment Navigator)  Industry Showcase: Ensuring Compliance From the Start: Suitability & Funds (Investment Navigator)


### Industry Showcase: Ensuring Compliance From the Start: Suitability & Funds (Investment Navigator)

Over the last few years we have seen
and experienced a wave of regulations
in the financial services industry
all around the world.
Typically, new regulations strive
for an increase of investor protection.

Because of this wave of regulations,
it is increasingly difficult
for financial service providers
to stay compliance
when conducting investment advice
whether it is in person or via robo-advisory.
Having pre- and post-trade checks in place
is not optional for banks,
it's mandatory to stay in business.

FinTech can help to establish such robust processes
by replacing error-prone
and inefficient manual compliance checks
with automated solution along the investment
and advisory value chain.

In our case of investmentnavigator.com,
technology enables
the entanglement of client context,
regulatory rules and product data
to assess suitability on the individual instrument level.
By acting upon suitability feedbacks,
banks can not only significantly reduce regulatory risks
and save time through the automation,
but also level up the client experience.

They get enabled to offer
the most cost-efficient suitable investment instrument
for the respective client context.
A very tangible benefit also for the client.

Behind the scenes,
the cloud-based rule engine
is the technological heart of Investment Navigator,
which allows us to deliver coherent suitability feedbacks
into every application along the investment
and advisory value chain.
It is therefore strategic for us
to provide our clients the complete freedom
to consume our Suitability Service
via one or several channels.

We currently maintain customised webpages,
an API to integrate into proprietary advisory tools
a core-banking adapter and an Excel add-in.
To sum-up, as a B2B FinTech company,
we believe that by pairing technology
with subject matter intelligence,
we simplify financial advice.
That's how FinTech creates a "win-win" situation
for financial service providers, as well as, customers.

#### Module 3 Alternative Finance   3.5 Crowdfunding – Regards, Charity and Equity   Video 3.5 Crowdfunding – Rewards, Charity and Equity


### Crowdfunding – Rewards, Charity and Equity

The concept of crowdfunding
is not as new as many may think.
The Statue of Liberty was famously known as
a gift from the French people
to commemorate the American Revolution.
What is less known is that there was
not enough funding for the base of the statue
and thus was actually crowdfunded by
Joseph Pulitzer by placing appeals
in the New York World newspaper in 1885
seeking contributions.

Crowdfunding's modern incarnation gained popularity
when Kickstarter launched in 2009
as an online platform to fund
creative projects campaigns
in exchange for rewards.

Although not its' initial main target audience,
Kickstarter became a favourite amongst
hardware enthusiasts who wanted to
fund minimum-batch-order production runs
of electronics in Shenzhen
and sought other enthusiasts to help with funding
and receive part of the batch run as rewards.
Gradually it became used more for pre-marketing
and product validation of
prototype consumer electronic, and other products,
and even incorporated by hardware accelerators
and venture capitalists.

Some of the most funded Kickstarter campaigns
were to fund smartwatch Pebble,
the Connected Coolest Cooler,
a Baubax, the travel jacket
made for electronic accessories.

Crowdfunding has been used
to benefit charities as well.
With sites like gofundme
having raised three billion U.S. Dollars
from over 25 million donors
across two million campaigns.
In China, Tencent's '99 Charity Day' in 2017
raised approximately 930 Million Yuan
or 126 Million U.S. Dollars from
over 12 million Wechat users
for charities running 6700 programmes
over a three-day period.

Many other crowdfunding platforms
have since emerged with different levels of curation.
For example, IndieGoGo does not have
a minimum all-or-nothing funding goal,
and does not require a working prototype.

More specialised platforms around sectors
or themes have also emerged.
Yet, before too long,
some backers began to question
this rewards approach.
In late 2012 Oculus Rift's 19 year-old founder
raised 2.4 million U.S. Dollars
offering it's virtual reality
head-mounted display as rewards.
Yet, less than two years later,
he sold the company to Facebook for two billion dollars.

Were rewards backers chumps?
If they could have received substantial upside
by receiving equity in Oculus Rift,
rather than V.R. Headgear?

In 2012 Congress passed the JOBS Act
which amongst other things legitimised
the concept of equity crowdfunding.
And in 2015, the SEC passed the Title IV regulations.
Many other countries around the world followed suit
to pass crowdfunding laws to encourage innovation,
and to allow direct retail investment into
early stage companies to augment current reliance
on private placement exemptions from
professional investors like venture capital firms,
and high-net-worth individuals.

The World Bank has predicted that
crowdfunding investments will be
a US$96 billion a year market
in developing countries alone by 2025.

And Goldman Sachs' analysts have heralded
crowdfunding as potentially the most disruptive
of all the new models of finance.
In essence, online capital marketplaces
have three main facets.

First, digital access by the general public
to learn more about,
and for the information to be posted by projects online.

Second, easy to use and secure fund flow
from the general public to support these projects.

And third, marketplaces where there is
sufficiency of information for decisions to be made
about the project and its' promoters that
enable matchmaking of projects
to the potential supporters.

So unlike traditional stock markets which
relied upon brokers and dealers as intermediaries,
individual investors could transact directly
which lead to many to describe this as
disintermediation and democratisation of finance.

Entrepreneurship and SMEs are well recognised as
important drivers of employment and innovation.
And television shows like **Shark Tank** in the U.S.
And **Dragon's Den** in the U.K. popularised
and encouraged the notion of entrepreneurs
seeking such early stage funding for their projects
and the general public's willingness and ability
to participate in these kinds of investment decisions
from their living room chairs.

If securities in the form of equities
or investment products are being offered
existing securities
and collective investment scheme laws and regulations
require perspectives to be prepared for
public offers unless they are private placements
made to sophisticated investors.

Crowdfunding legislation introduced specifically
recognised such limitations of existing laws
and are designed to allow SMEs and entrepreneurs
to be able to more cost-effectively tap
funding from the general public
with specific consumer protection elements built in.
Examples of these elements include
limiting the size of qualified companies,
capping investor, investment amounts,
and requiring investor cooling-off periods.
Minimum disclosure and lockups
as well as licensing the marketplace portals.
Yet, equity was just the first financial instrument
to utilise this new distributed
peer-to-peer model of finance.
More was to come.
