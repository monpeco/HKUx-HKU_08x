#### Module 3 Alternative Finance   3.1 Module 3 Introduction   Video 3.1 Module 3 Introduction

Alternative Finance,
can broadly be described as
comprising financial channels and instruments
that emerge outside the traditional financial system.

In my chapter in The Fintech Book,
which has recently been translated
and published in China,
I have called some of these emerging
financial channels, online capital marketplaces.


Alternative finance can also refer
to the new investment classes
being sought to be created,
including equity and loans to SMEs,
and more recently, crypto assets.

In this module, we will discuss the following:
* A brief history of finance and its innovations.
* The digitization of financial services.
* The opportunities and challenges of distributed peer-to-peer models of finance, such as crowdfunding, marketplace lending and token sales.
* The rise of the Chinese TechFins in its new models and products.
* How the banks are now positioning themselves as technology companies.

Finance can and should be
an enabler of commerce and investment
in growing the real economy
as well as to provide individuals
with more personal security
against life's vicissitudes.

Money or currency consists of
a stored value instrument that is scarce.
Throughout the ages,
these have ranged from cowry shells
to gold and minted metal coinage.
In the west,
money lenders have existed since the Roman Empire
where individuals have made
private loans to those who needed it.
There has long been widespread
religious and moral condemnation against usury.

The charging of interest for loans
with different religions taking different stances
on the permissible extent of such interest.
For example, the Islamic faith prohibits
any charging of interest whereas
the Judaic faith permits charging interest to non-Jews.


Modern legislation focuses more on setting limits
on the amount of permissible interest set.

Florence sat at the centre of the Renaissance
due in part to the extensive trade
through the Italian city
leading to over 100 banks being there
by the end of the 14th Century.

The Medici banking empire
was one such example
and was the banker for the Catholic Church.
Its expansion was aided by the invention
of double-entry bookkeeping by
Franciscan friar, Luca Pacioli
which allowed for reliable documentation
for both creditor and debtor.

The Tang and Song Dynasty emperors
in the seventh century started using paper
which their forefathers in China invented
as bank notes or jiaozi,
that were originally used as promissory notes
and became a lightweight alternative
to heavy and metallic coinage.

To address counterfeiting,
a variety of techniques involving different inks,
papers and seals were used.

Property and being able to prove ownership
is critical as sources of collateral for finance.
Pawn shops such as the medieval practise
of so-called Lombard banking
dealt in the delivery of goods and custody
and many legal jurisdictions developed
centralised land record registries
that enabled more lending to take place.

As international trade grew,
the financing of those ocean expeditions
of vast durations and distances
involved substantial risk.
With the invention of the joint stock company
shares and bonds could be
issued to the general public to fund projects
and the Dutch East India Company
listing in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange
paved the way in the 17th Century.

Similar venues were set up across the ocean
at coffee shops along London's exchange alley,
and under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street,
and sea captains and merchants also met
at Lloyd's Coffee House at London's Tower Street.
These soon evolved into powerful institutions,
today's London Stock Exchange,
New York Stock Exchange
and Lloyd's of London

Within these buildings,
trading runners or deer would dash to
nearby brokerage offices
to deliver stock quotes
from the brokers on the exchange floor.
With the invention of electricity,
technologies like the telegraph
and then the telephone soon meant
proximity to the exchanges proved less critical.

In 1971, Nasdaq became the first electronic exchange
with many other securities and
commodities exchanges following suit.
A new electronic and digital era was dawning.
