#### Module 3 Alternative Finance   3.1 Module 3 Introduction   Video 3.1 Module 3 Introduction

Alternative Finance,
can broadly be described as
comprising financial channels and instruments
that emerge outside the traditional financial system.

In my chapter in The Fintech Book,
which has recently been translated
and published in China,
I have called some of these emerging
financial channels, online capital marketplaces.


Alternative finance can also refer
to the new investment classes
being sought to be created,
including equity and loans to SMEs,
and more recently, crypto assets.

In this module, we will discuss the following:
* A brief history of finance and its innovations.
* The digitization of financial services.
* The opportunities and challenges of distributed peer-to-peer models of finance, such as crowdfunding, marketplace lending and token sales.
* The rise of the Chinese TechFins in its new models and products.
* How the banks are now positioning themselves as technology companies.
