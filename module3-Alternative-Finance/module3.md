#### Module 3 Alternative Finance   3.1 Module 3 Introduction   Video 3.1 Module 3 Introduction

Alternative Finance,
can broadly be described as
comprising financial channels and instruments
that emerge outside the traditional financial system.

In my chapter in The Fintech Book,
which has recently been translated
and published in China,
I have called some of these emerging
financial channels, online capital marketplaces.


Alternative finance can also refer
to the new investment classes
being sought to be created,
including equity and loans to SMEs,
and more recently, crypto assets.

In this module, we will discuss the following:
* A brief history of finance and its innovations.
* The digitization of financial services.
* The opportunities and challenges of distributed peer-to-peer models of finance, such as crowdfunding, marketplace lending and token sales.
* The rise of the Chinese TechFins in its new models and products.
* How the banks are now positioning themselves as technology companies.

Finance can and should be
an enabler of commerce and investment
in growing the real economy
as well as to provide individuals
with more personal security
against life's vicissitudes.

Money or currency consists of
a stored value instrument that is scarce.
Throughout the ages,
these have ranged from cowry shells
to gold and minted metal coinage.
In the west,
money lenders have existed since the Roman Empire
where individuals have made
private loans to those who needed it.
There has long been widespread
religious and moral condemnation against usury.

The charging of interest for loans
with different religions taking different stances
on the permissible extent of such interest.
For example, the Islamic faith prohibits
any charging of interest whereas
the Judaic faith permits charging interest to non-Jews.


Modern legislation focuses more on setting limits
on the amount of permissible interest set.

Florence sat at the centre of the Renaissance
due in part to the extensive trade
through the Italian city
leading to over 100 banks being there
by the end of the 14th Century.

The Medici banking empire
was one such example
and was the banker for the Catholic Church.
Its expansion was aided by the invention
of double-entry bookkeeping by
Franciscan friar, Luca Pacioli
which allowed for reliable documentation
for both creditor and debtor.

The Tang and Song Dynasty emperors
in the seventh century started using paper
which their forefathers in China invented
as bank notes or jiaozi,
that were originally used as promissory notes
and became a lightweight alternative
to heavy and metallic coinage.

To address counterfeiting,
a variety of techniques involving different inks,
papers and seals were used.

Property and being able to prove ownership
is critical as sources of collateral for finance.
Pawn shops such as the medieval practise
of so-called Lombard banking
dealt in the delivery of goods and custody
and many legal jurisdictions developed
centralised land record registries
that enabled more lending to take place.

As international trade grew,
the financing of those ocean expeditions
of vast durations and distances
involved substantial risk.
With the invention of the joint stock company
shares and bonds could be
issued to the general public to fund projects
and the Dutch East India Company
listing in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange
paved the way in the 17th Century.

Similar venues were set up across the ocean
at coffee shops along London's exchange alley,
and under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street,
and sea captains and merchants also met
at Lloyd's Coffee House at London's Tower Street.
These soon evolved into powerful institutions,
today's London Stock Exchange,
New York Stock Exchange
and Lloyd's of London

Within these buildings,
trading runners or deer would dash to
nearby brokerage offices
to deliver stock quotes
from the brokers on the exchange floor.
With the invention of electricity,
technologies like the telegraph
and then the telephone soon meant
proximity to the exchanges proved less critical.

In 1971, Nasdaq became the first electronic exchange
with many other securities and
commodities exchanges following suit.
A new electronic and digital era was dawning.

#### Module 3 Alternative Finance   3.3 Digitization of Financial Services   Video 3.3 Digitization of Financial Services


**Financial investment** and trading
can best be understood as
comprising of two groups.

First, **retail investment and trading
of public companies** is conducted
by the general public on exchanges
through brokers and dealers.

Second, **institutional investment and trading**
involves large financial institutions
who buy and sell publicly listed securities
between each other.

In the meantime,
the investment into private companies
has been the remit of specialised investors,
such as venture capital and private equity firms,
with so called exit or liquidity events
being an initial public offering
into the public markets
or trade sale of the business.

The venture capital firms
on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California,
were likely instrumental in investing and growing
what become known as Silicon Valley.
Including their successes in hardware
being turned into software and the internet
that gave rise to the dot com boom.

One major development at that time
was when online brokerage firm E*Trade
was able to get allocations
to some of the hot tech IPOs.

Electronic banking also started expanding
as major banks extended services to consumers
who were increasingly coming online
with the lowering costs
and increasing ease of access.

At the same time,
institutional trading expanded dramatically,
with alternative trading systems and **dark pools**
allowing financial institutions to trade
large blocks of securities at one time
to minimise pricing impact.

At the same time,
proprietary trading at desks invested and develop
**automated algorithmic trading programmes**,
as well as high frequency trading programmes
that use computational power
to devise trading strategies
and automate trading in ways no human could.

The global financial crisis in 2007
changed the landscape dramatically.
After the bursting of the sub prime mortgage bubble,
and the rapid devaluation of financial instruments,
such as mortgage backed securities
and credit default swaps,
many major financial institutions collapsed,
or needed to be bailed out by their governments.

Lending then dried up by many traditional lenders,
and many governments sought to encourage
the emergence of new players and business models
that provided alternative finance
to individuals and businesses.

At the same time,
**2010's flash crash**
saw the Dow Jones Index drop
nine percent within minutes
and was subsequently attributed
to high frequency traders initialling,
spoofing algorithms
that placed thousands of orders
with intention of cancelling them.
The automatic shutting down
of many automated computerised traders
due to the extreme drop
also led to a rapid loss of liquidity.

In the European Union,
challenger banks were encouraged
and has culminated
in open banking policies such as
the payment services directive,
which forces banks to produce customer data
to make it **easier for customers
to switch financial providers**.
Some of these banks were also virtual banks,
with no branches at all.

In the United States,
a stark reminder that
it was not business as usual
can be seen in the before and after pictures
of UBS's famed trading floor in Stanford, Connecticut.
This was once the largest in the world
with 5,000 stock, bond and currency traders.

The global financial crisis resulted,
amongst other things,
in the passing of **Dodd-Frank**,
which prohibited proprietary trading by banks,
and the **Jump Start Our Business Startups Act**,
or JOBS Act in 2012,
which legitimised the concept
of equity crowdfunding in law.
The era of distributed peer-to-peer models
of finance was born.

The rise of P2P lending after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis was encouraged because:
* (A) Bank credit became more easily available
* (B) regulators loosened regulation of banks
* (C) RTGS systems were opened to individuals instead of only banks
* (D) None of the above

#### Module 3 Alternative Finance   3.4 FinTech & Funds   Video 3.4 FinTech and Funds

As we all know, FinTech is really disrupting
many verticals of the financial services industry,
from investment banking,
asset management, retail banking.
But one area that it's also affecting as well
is the hedge fund industry.

For many years, the hedge fund industry
was the most entrepreneurial,
at the cutting edge of technology.
And obviously, a lot of Fintech innovations
are benefiting the broader hedge fund industry as well.

There's many examples.
Think about it.
Imagine I'm a fund manager.
Normally I try to access data
that is available publicly
and I'm trying to use.
But what if I can use some of the big data analytics
and artificial intelligence solutions
to try to really generate insights?

Imagine using satellite imagery to try to look at
what's happening on, let's say, on oil containers
and how much oil there are on the ships.

Or actually looking from satellite imagery
how many cars are in the parking lot
and use that to try to actually forecast
a company's actually earnings.

Or imagine being able to use
some of the latest technology to read,
go through all the news articles
around the world available online
or all the tweets and Facebook messages
and be able to come up with a sentiment analysis
of what are people really seeing
and thinking around the world

today a lot of people
want to get access to research.
A normal hedge fund manager would actually try
to work with an investment bank,
will actually execute some of their traits
via an investment bank to get access
to some of their research analysts.
But if you think about it,
it's not very efficient.
It's a bit like buying a CD if you like one song.

What now we're seeing the emergence
of independent platforms.
If you think about the Spotify of research
where investment analysts can actually go there,
put your own research.
And if customers like them,
they just go pay for the research and pay
for that specific investment analyst.

FinTech is affecting the way business is done.
Today, anybody launches a hedge fund or a fund,
will generally try to go raise money from investors.
That service is now offered by investment banks
who will try to match hedge fund managers
and hedge fund investors.
The way that process works is very inefficient.
Often via conferences and
personal meetings or emails,
it's actually not very efficient.
We are now seeing the emergence of online platforms
where these two branches can actually connect.
And actually you have analytics
and data on who can be a good fit for each other.
