### Welcome to Introduction of FinTech

> FinTech involves the use
> of technology, particularly information technology to transform the
> way that finance is being done in global markets, developing
> countries, and across start-ups and tech firms. 20 years ago, IBM
> spent $100 million to build Deep Blue, the super computer that beat
> Garry Kasparov. This smartphone is more powerful than Deep Blue. If
> you want to be in finance today, you need to understand technology.
> RegTech, short for regulatory technology may be a game changer as it
> will allow financial institutions to deal with compliance and
> regulatory burdens, not only more effectively, but also more
> efficiently. FinTech flourishes where the need is greatest. China
> leads the world in many regards. YueBao is a money market fund enabled
> by FinTech in China. In 9 months, it became the fourth largest in the
> world. Now 3 years later, it is the world's largest. FinTech has
> evolved over 3 eras, from infrastructure to banks to start-ups,
> entrepreneurs today are building the B2B solution that will be
> powering the financial system tomorrow. This course will be an
> illustration of how this is happening today. In the future, finance
> will be about an experience, not a product. That's why it's important
> for students today to understand how the industry is changing and
> that's what this course will be about.

> lessons from our experiences and also look at some of the big trends
> going forward. So, we very much look forward to you joining this in
> our journey across FinTech. At the end of this course, we very much
> hope you will have an overall understanding of what is FinTech, of

#### Module 1 What is FinTech?   > 1.1 Welcome to Module 1   > Module 1 Learning Objectives

Module 1 introduces the evolution, context, opportunities, and challenges of FinTech. 
It highlights to students that FinTech should be defined by the user of technology as 
opposed to simply the fact of using technology (the Who not the What) so as to better 
understand why this industry is growing ever more rapidly and with it what opportunities 
and risks it creates.

**Key Learning Objectives:**

* **Understand how finance and technology have evolved** and are transforming finance 
  around the world.
* **Discuss key interactions between finance and technology over time**, in order to 
  better understand the developments which are taking place today and are likely to 
  take place in the future.
* **Consider the broad spectrum of the financial sector and the way that technology 
  is changing it faster than ever before**, particularly with the explosion of new 
  entrants, including startups, tech firms and emerging markets.
* **Consider both the opportunities as well as the potential risks of FinTech** and 
  the challenges it poses for policymakers.

### Video 1.2 FinTech Transformation

What caused the rise of FinTech?

Traditionally, banks were..
* Innovative
* Kept up with technology

2008 Global Financial Crisis
* Things changed..

During that time, bank prioritised
* Regulations and Compliance

Game changing innovations emerged
There was a gab between "Proposition of banks" and the "Customers' expectations", and the FinTech industry is trying to fill.

But the changes took place both **FinTech Startups** and **Large Tech Firms** (Amazon, Tencent, Ant Financial).

Large Tech Firms have:
* Funding
* Backing
* Talent
* Capital pool
* Consumer trust



> Hi there, very excited to be here. My name is Henri Aslanian and my

> And I'm very lucky to be able to do this in my academic life as an
> Adjunct Associate Professor here at the University of Hong Kong, where
> I teach the first FinTech university course in Asia. Also very lucky

> leader here for Hong Kong for PwC. Very excited to be sharing about
> the latest developments going on in the broader FinTech space
> throughout this course. One question often pops up is that how come
> FinTech became such a big reality? What really caused the rise of
> FinTech? Well it's a very interesting question. Traditionally,
> actually as technology evolved banks were pretty good at also always
> keeping up with technology and in many cases, being some of the early
> adopters. But all of this really changed during the global financial
> crisis in 2008. During that time, banks and financial institutions
> were busy dealing with regulations, compliance, and other many
> regulatory enforcement situations that were taking place. Innovation
> became a very, very distant priority. But at the same time, some of
> the biggest game changing innovations that took place that have
> changed our lives took place. Think about Uber, WhatsApp, WeChat, or
> Airbnb, and many others that really changed the way customers ahead
> experience the services they were receiving in many industries, except
> financial services, and this gap was created between what financial
> institutions were offering to their customers and what customers came
> to expect. And this gap is what the FinTech industry wanted to tackle.
> And the FinTech industry wanted to tackle very many of the used cases
> that matched the pain points that were in this industry. However, it
> was not only the startups. And actually what we realised over the
> course of the years is actually some of the biggest gamechanging
> technological innovations took place not only by FinTech startups but
> by large technology firms. Think about firms like Amazon, or Tencent,
> or AntFinancial and many others who have started now looking at
> financial services. And in the future there's actually a big chance
> that some of the providers of financial services, at least the
> interface that clients will be using may be these large technology
> firms. So definitely an area to watch. And what are some of the
> advantages these large technology firms have over some of these
> startups? Not only do they have the funding, they have the backing,
> and the talent, and the pool, capital pool to actually support these
> new businesses, but to certain extent, they have the trust of
> consumers. Think about it, if you're happy to buy all your daily
> necessities on Amazon, or on Taobao, wouldn't you use them as well to
> actually, you know, buy insurance products? If you're actually using
> the Facebook Messenger to actually talk to your friends and family
> wouldn't you use them as well to send money to friends and family as
> well? Well, as you can see, it's going to be a very interesting
> ecosystem developing over the coming years not only with FinTech, but
> also by TechFin. Definitely an area to watch.
