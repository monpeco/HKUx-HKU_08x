### Welcome to Introduction of FinTech

> FinTech involves the use
> of technology, particularly information technology to transform the
> way that finance is being done in global markets, developing
> countries, and across start-ups and tech firms. 20 years ago, IBM
> spent $100 million to build Deep Blue, the super computer that beat
> Garry Kasparov. This smartphone is more powerful than Deep Blue. If
> you want to be in finance today, you need to understand technology.
> RegTech, short for regulatory technology may be a game changer as it
> will allow financial institutions to deal with compliance and
> regulatory burdens, not only more effectively, but also more
> efficiently. FinTech flourishes where the need is greatest. China
> leads the world in many regards. YueBao is a money market fund enabled
> by FinTech in China. In 9 months, it became the fourth largest in the
> world. Now 3 years later, it is the world's largest. FinTech has
> evolved over 3 eras, from infrastructure to banks to start-ups,
> entrepreneurs today are building the B2B solution that will be
> powering the financial system tomorrow. This course will be an
> illustration of how this is happening today. In the future, finance
> will be about an experience, not a product. That's why it's important
> for students today to understand how the industry is changing and
> that's what this course will be about.

#### Module 1 What is FinTech?   > 1.1 Welcome to Module 1   > Module 1 Learning Objectives

Module 1 introduces the evolution, context, opportunities, and challenges of FinTech. 
It highlights to students that FinTech should be defined by the user of technology as 
opposed to simply the fact of using technology (the Who not the What) so as to better 
understand why this industry is growing ever more rapidly and with it what opportunities 
and risks it creates.

**Key Learning Objectives:**

* **Understand how finance and technology have evolved** and are transforming finance 
  around the world.
* **Discuss key interactions between finance and technology over time**, in order to 
  better understand the developments which are taking place today and are likely to 
  take place in the future.
* **Consider the broad spectrum of the financial sector and the way that technology 
  is changing it faster than ever before**, particularly with the explosion of new 
  entrants, including startups, tech firms and emerging markets.
* **Consider both the opportunities as well as the potential risks of FinTech** and 
  the challenges it poses for policymakers.

### Video 1.2 FinTech Transformation

What caused the rise of FinTech?

Traditionally, banks were..
* Innovative
* Kept up with technology

2008 Global Financial Crisis
* Things changed..

During that time, bank prioritised
* Regulations and Compliance

Game changing innovations emerged
There was a gab between "Proposition of banks" and the "Customers' expectations", and the FinTech industry is trying to fill.

But the changes took place both **FinTech Startups** and **Large Tech Firms** (Amazon, Tencent, Ant Financial).

Large Tech Firms have:
* Funding
* Backing
* Talent
* Capital pool
* Consumer trust

> actually as technology evolved banks were pretty good at also always
> keeping up with technology and in many cases, being some of the early
> adopters. But all of this really changed during the global financial
> crisis in 2008. During that time, banks and financial institutions
> were busy dealing with regulations, compliance, and other many

> experience the services they were receiving in many industries, except
> financial services, and this gap was created between what financial
> institutions were offering to their customers and what customers came
> to expect. And this gap is what the FinTech industry wanted to tackle.
> And the FinTech industry wanted to tackle very many of the used cases

> was not only the startups. And actually what we realised over the
> course of the years is actually some of the biggest gamechanging
> technological innovations took place not only by FinTech startups but
> by large technology firms. Think about firms like Amazon, or Tencent,
> or AntFinancial and many others who have started now looking at
> financial services. And in the future there's actually a big chance
> that some of the providers of financial services, at least the
> interface that clients will be using may be these large technology
> firms. So definitely an area to watch. And what are some of the
> advantages these large technology firms have over some of these
> startups? Not only do they have the funding, they have the backing,
> and the talent, and the pool, capital pool to actually support these
> new businesses, but to certain extent, they have the trust of

> actually, you know, buy insurance products? If you're actually using
> the Facebook Messenger to actually talk to your friends and family
> wouldn't you use them as well to send money to friends and family as
> well? Well, as you can see, it's going to be a very interesting
> ecosystem developing over the coming years not only with FinTech, but
> also by TechFin. Definitely an area to watch.

**FinTech 1.0 - Infrastructure**

Finance and technology have been inextricably intertwined since the beginning.

One of the first physical technologies to develop was **money**, the simple 
coin and after paper money.

**Money is a form of technology** that allows us to psychically handle the ideas 
embedded in finance.

**Coins**, **paper money**, **system of writing** or **accounting**, major points 
include the evolution of the **joint stock company** or **the corporation**, 
forms of financing like **banking**, or more recently, **stocks**, **bonds**,
things that we would call **securities** or **derivatives**.

Derivatives are financial instruments whose value derives from some underlying 
financial instrument

The modern period of fintech begin in **1867**, because was the date of the 
establishment of the first **transatlantic telegraph cable**, that made possible 
instantaneous communication between the major markets of New York and London

More physical cable are necessary today

Many would say that the period from 1860's up to the start of the First World War 
was a period of financial and economic globalisation.

The Victorian internet (Transatlantic telegraph cable)

During the Second World War, significant effort spent in the context of developing 
codes for **secure communications** particularly of military and intelligence operations, 
as well to develop systems to break those codes.

Process of **in-coding / breaking codes* leads to **Computer technology** and 
to **AI**

But it wasn't until the period after the Second World War that we begin to see 
progressive development of those early computer technologies to eventually lay 
the ground work for the sort of **FinTech** and **RegTech**.


**Video 1.3 FinTech Evolution 1.0: Infrastructure**

#### Module 1 What is FinTech?   1.4 FinTech Evolution 2.0: Banks   Video 1.4 FinTech Evolution 2.0: Banks

**FinTech 2.0 - Banks**

The second major era of the modern FinTech evolution, what we call FinTech 2.0, 
started in **1967**. 1967 marks 2 very important dates in the evolution of 
finance and technology.

The first, is **the establisment of the first ATM (Automated Teller Machine)**
by Barclays Bank in the UK.

The second, is **the launch of the first handheld calculator** by Texas Instruments.

1967 - **The Process of Digitalization** began, it marks a period where we begin to 
see a process of digitization.

From this early beginnings, we can see a global financial markets, three very 
significant trents that come together in today's globan financial markets.

The first, the late 1960's and early 1970's the establishment of a series of 
domestic and international electronic payment systems. This payment systems allows 
large value payments to take place today on a real time basis, which underpins 
massive volumens of transactions around the world.
From a border standpoint, perhabs the most significant of these is an organization, 
which we'll turn to in module 2, called **SWIFT**. SWIFT is an organization, which 
**provides protocols to enable communications between domestic digital payment systems**.

The second, in 1971 the establishment of **NASDAQ**. NASDAQ was the world first 
electronic stock exchange. Yoday there are almost no stock exchanges or other 
financial exchanges, which are not electronic.

Basically, this events has fundamentally transformed the way these markets work, 
so much so that today it is very difficult to find a human being actually trading 
securities with another human being is stock markets.

At another level, if we think of today's global foreign exchange markets, these 
markets today do approximately 5.5 trillion dollars a day, every day of the year, 
and almost none of this takes place in the form of cash. It is almost entirely 
digital books entries taking place between the computer systems of major financial 
institutions.

This process, however, is one that was well established by the late 1980's. A
**major market crash occurred in 1987**. That market crash, today our best explanation, 
is what is called **Programable Trading**. Programable Trading involves preset 
computerised buy and sell orders, and so when stock prices drop to a certain level, 
this would trigger automatic selling by computer programs, which would trigger 
more prices drops, triggering more sales and eventually resulting in our **first 
major coordinated global market crash**.

Now, across 1980's we began with the origins of **online banking** in parallel 
to the emergence of the internet.

If we think in terms of developments, we can think that 1999 marked a previous 
high. 1999 was the **Internet Bubble**, the **Doncom Crash**, and it highlights 
something that's very important in the context of today's FinTech. As human beings, 
we tend to overestimate the short term impact of new technologies and underestimate 
the long term impact of new technologies.

After all, if we think to some of the 1999 internet bubble companies like Amazon or 
Google, certainly, at that time, we overestimated their short term impact, but 
looking back almost 20 years, almost no one would have imagined how significant 
Google, Amazon and other similar sorts of technology companies have become.

This period of building the digitization of the financial system hit a major turning
point in 2008 with the global financial crisis.

#### Module 1 What is FinTech?  > 1.5 FinTech Evolution 3.0 & 3.5: Startups & Emerging Markets  > Video 1.5 FinTech Evolution 3.0 & 3.5: Startups & Emerging Markets

**FinTech 3.0 - Startups**
**FinTech 3.5 - Emerging Markets**

2008 stated in the subprime real estate markets of the United States and spread 
throughout the global financial systems to major developed markets around the world, 
as well impacting developing and emerging market contries through the economic 
slowdown that from the standpoint of trade, was just as severe as the slowdown 
that we saw in the 1930's in the aftermarch of the 1929 crisis.

From the standpoint of FinTech, the global financial crisis had a number of very 
important features.

How 2008 impacted the development of FinTech:

1. **Unemployment**: job losses in the financial sector, particularly amongst younger people, forcing them to look now opportunities.
2. **Regulatory Changes**: as reaction to the global financial crisis, designed to prohibit ot to prevent the sorts of problems that emerged in 2008, which resulted in a dramatic decrease in profitability. In many ways the only way that these new requirements could be addressed was via technology.
3. **Distrust in Bank**.
4. **Invention of Smartphone**.

This combiantion has led to an explosion in startups, like **Bitcoin** and other 
cryptocurrency based on **Blockchain** or distributed ledger technologies.

Other have involved varios forms of altenative finance like **P2P lending** 
(Peer-to-peer lending), of forms of **Crowdfunding**.

But startups in the context of FinTech are even not new, in 1999 one of those internet 
bubble startups was PayPal (one of the world's most significant payment services 
providers along with Visa or MasterCard.

Or even before that, Bloomberg. Bloomberg today is the world's most valuable private 
information service firm.

So, the period of FinTech 3.0, the explosion of startups since the global financial 
crisis is new in terms of numbers, volume, transformative potential but we have seen 
FinTech startups before.

The other area where the tasnformations has been perhaps more dramatic is in the 
context of developing countries and emerging markets.

2007 marks the launch of Impesa, a mobile phone based payment system, which transformed 
access to finance of a large portion of the population in Kenya, and it's when we 
combine mobile payment with smartphone that we see the transformation of financial 
services that is taking place particularly in China with Alibaba, Tencent and others.

#### Module 1 What is FinTech?  > Industry Showcase: Collaboration between Financial Institutions and Startups (The FinTech Association of Hong Kong  


**Collaboration between financial institutions and startups**

Initially we saw a lot of work done by FinTechs trying to do it on themselves, 
looking to disrupt financial services and also the banks at one stage, looking 
to be more guarded about how they use technology, especially FinTechs with them.

But as reality dawned in the markets, such as Hong Kong, which is largely a 
business-to-business, people realised that there needs to be a lot of **Collaboration**.

Banks need a longer time for transformation, but they also need to be able to be 
more agile with regards to adopting new technologies.

FinTechs, they dond have a long runway, and the also aren´t able to have the 
required capital if the want to face off with banks.

Secondly, what we are seeing now is banks are not just collaborating with FinTechs, 
but they are going a step ahead and some of them are **acquiring** them through 
strategic investments.

Three, **Cross-regional Collaboration**, you see a certain strands of different 
FinTechs in different regions, and what banks are trying to do is try to find 
these FinTechs here.

Lastly, it is very important that **Compliance** plays a role in making this effort 
of collaboration between banks and FinTechs faster.

**Onboarding** is a very important factor, time can be shortened, it gives the 
starups more time to present POC and be onboarded with the banks.

**Banking is going to be change not by disruption, but through collaboration**.

#### Module 1 What is FinTech?   1.6 FinTech Typology   Video 1.6 FinTech Typology

### FinTech Typology

1. Finance and Investment
2. Operations and Risk Management
3. Payments and Infrastructure
4. Data Security and Monitization
5. Technology in the Customer Interface


**1. Finnce and Investment**

Alternative Financing (Creating new forms of financing)
- Crowdfunding
- P2P Lending
- ICOs (Initial Coin Offering)


Transform tradicional forms of financing, Think of Stock Markets, Hedge Funds and Investments Funds

**2. Operations and Risk Managements**

***Pre 2008 Financial Crisis***

- Focused on Quantitative Risk Modelling Techniques, e.g. VAR (Value-at-Risk Systems)

**Since 2008**, financial institutions,
as well as regulators,
have continued to be amongst the largest spenders
of any industry in the world on IT,
focusing in particular,
on new regulatory requirements,
as well as, risk management systems

**3. Payments and infrastrure**

Electronic Payments is one of our primary areas of direct inteaction with fintech,
over the internet or using our mobile phone, o using a QR code; simple techniques 
which allow intantaneous payments. But also the 5.5 Trillion dollar a day global 
currency markets take place in a completely digitised enviroment and new technologies 
like Blockchain, of Distributed Ledger Technology are transforming traditional 
large value digital payments.

**4. Data Security and Monetization**

All this digitization brings with both opportunities as well as risks. On the
opportunity side, digitization of ever increasing sources and forms of data has 
allowed a new process of **Datafication**. Datafication is the application of 
sophisticated analytics systems, like Big Data or Artificial Intelligence and 
the like, in order to analyse large volumes of data, to come up with new approaches 
of new ways to monetize those sources of data.

But at the same time, with data incresingly in digital-only form, risk of security 
of security.

If everything is digitsed, the risk of cybersecurity have moved from being a 
business risk, to a financial stability risk, to a national security risk today.

**5. Technologies in the customer interface**

How we interact with these forms of finance provides not only greater opportunities 
for individuals in terms of convenience and access, but also new business technologies.
