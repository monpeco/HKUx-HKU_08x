### Welcome to Introduction of FinTech

> FinTech involves the use
> of technology, particularly information technology to transform the
> way that finance is being done in global markets, developing
> countries, and across start-ups and tech firms. 20 years ago, IBM
> spent $100 million to build Deep Blue, the super computer that beat
> Garry Kasparov. This smartphone is more powerful than Deep Blue. If
> you want to be in finance today, you need to understand technology.
> RegTech, short for regulatory technology may be a game changer as it
> will allow financial institutions to deal with compliance and
> regulatory burdens, not only more effectively, but also more
> efficiently. FinTech flourishes where the need is greatest. China
> leads the world in many regards. YueBao is a money market fund enabled
> by FinTech in China. In 9 months, it became the fourth largest in the
> world. Now 3 years later, it is the world's largest. FinTech has
> evolved over 3 eras, from infrastructure to banks to start-ups,
> entrepreneurs today are building the B2B solution that will be
> powering the financial system tomorrow. This course will be an
> illustration of how this is happening today. In the future, finance
> will be about an experience, not a product. That's why it's important
> for students today to understand how the industry is changing and
> that's what this course will be about.
