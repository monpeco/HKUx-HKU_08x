### Welcome to Introduction of FinTech

> FinTech involves the use
> of technology, particularly information technology to transform the
> way that finance is being done in global markets, developing
> countries, and across start-ups and tech firms. 20 years ago, IBM
> spent $100 million to build Deep Blue, the super computer that beat
> Garry Kasparov. This smartphone is more powerful than Deep Blue. If
> you want to be in finance today, you need to understand technology.
> RegTech, short for regulatory technology may be a game changer as it
> will allow financial institutions to deal with compliance and
> regulatory burdens, not only more effectively, but also more
> efficiently. FinTech flourishes where the need is greatest. China
> leads the world in many regards. YueBao is a money market fund enabled
> by FinTech in China. In 9 months, it became the fourth largest in the
> world. Now 3 years later, it is the world's largest. FinTech has
> evolved over 3 eras, from infrastructure to banks to start-ups,
> entrepreneurs today are building the B2B solution that will be
> powering the financial system tomorrow. This course will be an
> illustration of how this is happening today. In the future, finance
> will be about an experience, not a product. That's why it's important
> for students today to understand how the industry is changing and
> that's what this course will be about.

### Video 1.1 Module 1 Introduction

> Welcome, my name is Douglas Arner and this is an introduction to
> FinTech. I am the Kerry Holdings Professor in Law at the University of
> Hong Kong and I have spent the past 25 years studying the interaction
> between finance, technology and regulation. And in this course, we are
> going to provide you an introduction to the world of FinTech.
> Financial technology transforming the world of finance and the wider
> world beyond faster than we have ever seen before. In this course, I
> am joined with a group of my friends from around the world, Ross
> Buckley of the University of New South Wales in Australia, Henri
> Arslanian of PwC, Brian Tang of the Asia Capital Markets Institute,
> Janos Barberis of SuperCharger and Huy Nguyen Trieu of the Centre for
> Finance, Technology and Entrepreneurship. In this course, we're going
> to begin by looking at the fundamental question. What is FinTech? And
> that is going to be module 1. For module 2, we'll turn to the next
> question which is money, payment and the transformation of finance
> through technology, looking at new things like cryptocurrencies,
> Bitcoin, blockchain as well as, mobile payments. In module 3, we'll
> turn to the digitization of finance and the development of new forms
> of alternative finance, crowdfunding, ICOs, new forms of lending and
> security settlement. In module 4, we'll turn to some of the bigger
> challenges, regulatory issues. How do we balance the opportunities and
> risks of FinTech so that we can make not only FinTech better but the
> financial system and the wider economy? In module 5, we'll turn to one
> of the biggest challenges facing the world of finance today and that
> is the interaction between data and finance and the emergence of an
> entirely new paradigm of data-driven finance which brings with it
> tremendous changes but also tremendous risks. And finally, in the last
> module, module 6, we'll look at a number of case studies to draw
> lessons from our experiences and also look at some of the big trends
> going forward. So, we very much look forward to you joining this in
> our journey across FinTech. At the end of this course, we very much
> hope you will have an overall understanding of what is FinTech, of
> some of the major technologies that are driving FinTech
> transformation, an understanding of what is happening not only in
> developing markets but in particular, in exciting new emerging
> markets, particularly in Asia. And finally, that you will be able to
