### Welcome to Introduction of FinTech

> FinTech involves the use
> of technology, particularly information technology to transform the
> way that finance is being done in global markets, developing
> countries, and across start-ups and tech firms. 20 years ago, IBM
> spent $100 million to build Deep Blue, the super computer that beat
> Garry Kasparov. This smartphone is more powerful than Deep Blue. If
> you want to be in finance today, you need to understand technology.
> RegTech, short for regulatory technology may be a game changer as it
> will allow financial institutions to deal with compliance and
> regulatory burdens, not only more effectively, but also more
> efficiently. FinTech flourishes where the need is greatest. China
> leads the world in many regards. YueBao is a money market fund enabled
> by FinTech in China. In 9 months, it became the fourth largest in the
> world. Now 3 years later, it is the world's largest. FinTech has
> evolved over 3 eras, from infrastructure to banks to start-ups,
> entrepreneurs today are building the B2B solution that will be
> powering the financial system tomorrow. This course will be an
> illustration of how this is happening today. In the future, finance
> will be about an experience, not a product. That's why it's important

#### Module 1 What is FinTech?   > 1.1 Welcome to Module 1   > Module 1 Learning Objectives

Module 1 introduces the evolution, context, opportunities, and challenges of FinTech. 
It highlights to students that FinTech should be defined by the user of technology as 
opposed to simply the fact of using technology (the Who not the What) so as to better 
understand why this industry is growing ever more rapidly and with it what opportunities 
and risks it creates.

**Key Learning Objectives:**

* **Understand how finance and technology have evolved** and are transforming finance 
  around the world.
* **Discuss key interactions between finance and technology over time**, in order to 
  better understand the developments which are taking place today and are likely to 
  take place in the future.
* **Consider the broad spectrum of the financial sector and the way that technology 
  is changing it faster than ever before**, particularly with the explosion of new 
  entrants, including startups, tech firms and emerging markets.
* **Consider both the opportunities as well as the potential risks of FinTech** and 
  the challenges it poses for policymakers.

### Video 1.2 FinTech Transformation

What caused the rise of FinTech?

Traditionally, banks were..
* Innovative
* Kept up with technology

2008 Global Financial Crisis
* Things changed..

During that time, bank prioritised
* Regulations and Compliance

Game changing innovations emerged
There was a gab between "Proposition of banks" and the "Customers' expectations", and the FinTech industry is trying to fill.

But the changes took place both **FinTech Startups** and **Large Tech Firms** (Amazon, Tencent, Ant Financial).

Large Tech Firms have:
* Funding
* Backing
* Talent
* Capital pool
* Consumer trust

> by large technology firms. Think about firms like Amazon, or Tencent,
> or AntFinancial and many others who have started now looking at
> financial services. And in the future there's actually a big chance
> that some of the providers of financial services, at least the
> interface that clients will be using may be these large technology
> firms. So definitely an area to watch. And what are some of the
> advantages these large technology firms have over some of these
> startups? Not only do they have the funding, they have the backing,
> and the talent, and the pool, capital pool to actually support these
> new businesses, but to certain extent, they have the trust of

> actually, you know, buy insurance products? If you're actually using
> the Facebook Messenger to actually talk to your friends and family
> wouldn't you use them as well to send money to friends and family as
> well? Well, as you can see, it's going to be a very interesting
> ecosystem developing over the coming years not only with FinTech, but
> also by TechFin. Definitely an area to watch.

**FinTech 1.0 - Infrastructure**

Finance and technology have been inextricably intertwined since the beginning.

One of the first physical technologies to develop was **money**, the simple 
coin and after paper money.

**Money is a form of technology** that allows us to psychically handle the ideas 
embedded in finance.

**Coins**, **paper money**, **system of writing** or **accounting**, major points 
include the evolution of the **joint stock company** or **the corporation**, 
forms of financing like **banking**, or more recently, **stocks**, **bonds**,
things that we would call **securities** or **derivatives**.

Derivatives are financial instruments whose value derives from some underlying 
financial instrument

The modern period of fintech begin in **1867**, because was the date of the 
establishment of the first **transatlantic telegraph cable**, that made possible 
instantaneous communication between the major markets of New York and London

More physical cable are necessary today

Many would say that the period from 1860's up to the start of the First World War 
was a period of financial and economic globalisation.

The Victorian internet (Transatlantic telegraph cable)

During the Second World War, significant effort spent in the context of developing 
codes for **secure communications** particularly of military and intelligence operations, 
as well to develop systems to break those codes.

Process of **in-coding / breaking codes* leads to **Computer technology** and 
to **AI**

But it wasn't until the period after the Second World War that we begin to see 
progressive development of those early computer technologies to eventually lay 
the ground work for the sort of **FinTech** and **RegTech**.


**Video 1.3 FinTech Evolution 1.0: Infrastructure**

#### Module 1 What is FinTech?   1.4 FinTech Evolution 2.0: Banks   Video 1.4 FinTech Evolution 2.0: Banks

**FinTech 2.0 - Banks**

The second major era of the modern FinTech evolution, what we call FinTech 2.0, 
started in **1967**. 1967 marks 2 very important dates in the evolution of 
finance and technology.

The first, is **the establisment of the first ATM (Automated Teller Machine)**
by Barclays Bank in the UK.

The second, is **the launch of the first handheld calculator** by Texas Instruments.

1967 - **The Process of Digitalization** began, it marks a period where we begin to 
see a process of digitization.

From this early beginnings, we can see a global financial markets, three very 
significant trents that come together in today's globan financial markets.

The first, the late 1960's and early 1970's the establishment of a series of 
domestic and international electronic payment systems. This payment systems allows 
large value payments to take place today on a real time basis, which underpins 
massive volumens of transactions around the world.
From a border standpoint, perhabs the most significant of these is an organization, 
which we'll turn to in module 2, called **SWIFT**. SWIFT is an organization, which 
**provides protocols to enable communications between domestic digital payment systems**.

The second, in 1971 the establishment of **NASDAQ**. NASDAQ was the world first 
electronic stock exchange. Yoday there are almost no stock exchanges or other 
financial exchanges, which are not electronic.

Basically, this events has fundamentally transformed the way these markets work, 
so much so that today it is very difficult to find a human being actually trading 
securities with another human being is stock markets.

At another level, if we think of today's global foreign exchange markets, these 
markets today do approximately 5.5 trillion dollars a day, every day of the year, 
and almost none of this takes place in the form of cash. It is almost entirely 
digital books entries taking place between the computer systems of major financial 
institutions.

This process, however, is one that was well established by the late 1980's. A
**major market crash occurred in 1987**. That market crash, today our best explanation, 
is what is called **Programable Trading**. Programable Trading involves preset 
computerised buy and sell orders, and so when stock prices drop to a certain level, 
this would trigger automatic selling by computer programs, which would trigger 
more prices drops, triggering more sales and eventually resulting in our **first 
major coordinated global market crash**.

Now, across 1980's we began with the origins of **online banking** in parallel 
to the emergence of the internet.

If we think in terms of developments, we can think that 1999 marked a previous 
high. 1999 was the **Internet Bubble**, the **Doncom Crash**, and it highlights 
something that's very important in the context of today's FinTech. As human beings, 
we tend to overestimate the short term impact of new technologies and underestimate 
the long term impact of new technologies.

After all, if we think to some of the 1999 internet bubble companies like Amazon or 
Google, certainly, at that time, we overestimated their short term impact, but 
looking back almost 20 years, almost no one would have imagined how significant 
Google, Amazon and other similar sorts of technology companies have become.

This period of building the digitization of the financial system hit a major turning
point in 2008 with the global financial crisis.

#### Module 1 What is FinTech?  > 1.5 FinTech Evolution 3.0 & 3.5: Startups & Emerging Markets  > Video 1.5 FinTech Evolution 3.0 & 3.5: Startups & Emerging Markets

**FinTech 3.0 - Startups**
**FinTech 3.5 - Emerging Markets**

2008 stated in the subprime real estate markets of the United States and spread 
throughout the global financial systems to major developed markets around the world, 
as well impacting developing and emerging market contries through the economic 
slowdown that from the standpoint of trade, was just as severe as the slowdown 
that we saw in the 1930's in the aftermarch of the 1929 crisis.

From the standpoint of FinTech, the global financial crisis had a number of very 
important features.

How 2008 impacted the development of FinTech:

1. **Unemployment**: job losses in the financial sector, particularly amongst younger people, forcing them to look now opportunities.
2. **Regulatory Changes**: as reaction to the global financial crisis, designed to prohibit ot to prevent the sorts of problems that emerged in 2008, which resulted in a dramatic decrease in profitability. In many ways the only way that these new requirements could be addressed was via technology.
3. **Distrust in Bank**.
4. **Invention of Smartphone**.

This combiantion has led to an explosion in startups, like **Bitcoin** and other 
cryptocurrency based on **Blockchain** or distributed ledger technologies.

Other have involved varios forms of altenative finance like **P2P lending** 
(Peer-to-peer lending), of forms of **Crowdfunding**.

But startups in the context of FinTech are even not new, in 1999 one of those internet 
bubble startups was PayPal (one of the world's most significant payment services 
providers along with Visa or MasterCard.

Or even before that, Bloomberg. Bloomberg today is the world's most valuable private 
information service firm.

So, the period of FinTech 3.0, the explosion of startups since the global financial 
crisis is new in terms of numbers, volume, transformative potential but we have seen 
FinTech startups before.

The other area where the tasnformations has been perhaps more dramatic is in the 
context of developing countries and emerging markets.

2007 marks the launch of Impesa, a mobile phone based payment system, which transformed 
access to finance of a large portion of the population in Kenya, and it's when we 
combine mobile payment with smartphone that we see the transformation of financial 
services that is taking place particularly in China with Alibaba, Tencent and others.

#### Module 1 What is FinTech?  > Industry Showcase: Collaboration between Financial Institutions and Startups (The FinTech Association of Hong Kong  


**Collaboration between financial institutions and startups**

Initially we saw a lot of work done by FinTechs trying to do it on themselves, 
looking to disrupt financial services and also the banks at one stage, looking 
to be more guarded about how they use technology, especially FinTechs with them.

But as reality dawned in the markets, such as Hong Kong, which is largely a 
business-to-business, people realised that there needs to be a lot of **Collaboration**.

Banks need a longer time for transformation, but they also need to be able to be 
more agile with regards to adopting new technologies.

FinTechs, they dond have a long runway, and the also aren´t able to have the 
required capital if the want to face off with banks.

Secondly, what we are seeing now is banks are not just collaborating with FinTechs, 
but they are going a step ahead and some of them are **acquiring** them through 
strategic investments.

Three, **Cross-regional Collaboration**, you see a certain strands of different 
FinTechs in different regions, and what banks are trying to do is try to find 
these FinTechs here.

Lastly, it is very important that **Compliance** plays a role in making this effort 
of collaboration between banks and FinTechs faster.

**Onboarding** is a very important factor, time can be shortened, it gives the 
starups more time to present POC and be onboarded with the banks.

**Banking is going to be change not by disruption, but through collaboration**.

### FinTech Typology

1. Finance and Investment
2. Operations and Risk Management
3. Payments and Infrastructure
4. Data Security and Monitization
5. Technology in the Customer Interface


**1. Finnce and Investment**

Alternative Financing (Creating new forms of financing)
- Crowdfunding
- P2P Lending
- ICOs (Initial Coin Offering)


Transform tradicional forms of financing, Think of Stock Markets, Hedge Funds and Investments Funds

**2. Operations and Risk Managements**

***Pre 2008 Financial Crisis***

- Focused on Quantitative Risk Modelling Techniques, e.g. VAR (Value-at-Risk Systems)

**Since 2008**, financial institutions,
as well as regulators,
have continued to be amongst the largest spenders
of any industry in the world on IT,
focusing in particular,
on new regulatory requirements,
as well as, risk management systems

**3. Payments and infrastrure**

Electronic Payments is one of our primary areas of direct inteaction with fintech,
over the internet or using our mobile phone, o using a QR code; simple techniques 
which allow intantaneous payments. But also the 5.5 Trillion dollar a day global 
currency markets take place in a completely digitised enviroment and new technologies 
like Blockchain, of Distributed Ledger Technology are transforming traditional 
large value digital payments.

**4. Data Security and Monetization**

All this digitization brings with both opportunities as well as risks. On the
opportunity side, digitization of ever increasing sources and forms of data has 
allowed a new process of **Datafication**. Datafication is the application of 
sophisticated analytics systems, like Big Data or Artificial Intelligence and 
the like, in order to analyse large volumes of data, to come up with new approaches 
of new ways to monetize those sources of data.

But at the same time, with data incresingly in digital-only form, risk of security 
of security.

If everything is digitsed, the risk of cybersecurity have moved from being a 
business risk, to a financial stability risk, to a national security risk today.

**5. Technologies in the customer interface**

How we interact with these forms of finance provides not only greater opportunities 
for individuals in terms of convenience and access, but also new business technologies.

#### Module 1 What is FinTech?  > 1.7 Emerging Economics: Opportunities and Challenges  > Video 1.7 Emerging Economics: Opportunities and Challenges

### Emerging Economics: Opportunities and Challenges

The developing countries and emerging markets have perhaps greater opportunities.

If we think in the story of Africa, Impesa in Kenya, the impact of mobile financial 
services through old-style mobile phones has been very significant. But there is a 
big limitation in these telephones compared with what we can do with a modern 
smartphone. 

The computing power that we can hold in our hands today is unprecedented from the 
standpoint of finance, and the transformation which is already taking place in Asia 
is amazing. Mainly, because of 2 significant features:

1. High penetration rates, high ownership rates of smartphones
2. The availability of broadband Internet access.

The combination of smartphones with broadband Internet access combines with a feature 
of many emarging markets around the world, which if often inefficient traditional 
banking and financial systems. This combination allows to leapfrog hundred of years 
of developments which took place in western markets in a short period of a few years.

Perhaps the best example is the major internet and e-commerce firms in China, firms 
like Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, or even traditional financial institutions like Ping An, 
the numbers of customers using their financial services are absolutely staggering.

In India, we will see a variety of technological infrastructure design elements to 
support expansion of finance to literate hundreds of millions of people who did not 
previously have access to financial services.

At the same time, these tremendous changes and opportunities also bring with them 
new risks. 

An idea that things can move faster that we've ever seen before, and if we look at 
the things that have changed in FinTech, it is the combination of new entrants, 
startups and technology companies, with the speed of change that is driving so 
much of the opportunities and the transformations.

But this combination of new entrants and speed of technology allos something else 
to happen as well, and that is for risks to grow ever more rapidly.

In an example, a new banking startup launched by a technology company can acquire 
in a weekend the amount that would have taken decades in a traditional developed 
market for a financial institution to achieve.

This is the risk that we call **Moving from to too small to care, to too big to fail** 
and it can now occur in record time.

### From Too-Small-To-Care to Too-Big-To-Fail

Financial techonology is a 150-yeras-old industry that has been divided in 3 eras.

The first era (FinTech 1.0) was a 100 years old, the second era (FinTech 2.0) was 
40 years old, and the third era, in which we are today will be about a decade old. 
As is shown each era is shorter that the previous one, that means that technology 
is changing faster, and is penetrating into the public at a faster rate than ever 
before.

Acquiring half a million customers is a very big feet But KakaoTalk
has been able to do that in only 2 days.

Finally, I can also give you the example of **Bitcoin**. Bitcoin is becoming more 
valuable faster than any other asset classes that previously have led to a bubble.
What Bitcoin has done in only one year, it took many more years for other classes 
to do.

Those examples are ilustration that technology is changing more and more rapidly, 
and therefore regulators need to adapt themselves.

In the following example we have en the Y-axis the size of a company, and on the 
X-axis you have the time it takes for that company to grow.
Normally we are used to understand, is the notion of **Organic Growth**. 

![organic-growth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16638078/40890567-222186e4-6746-11e8-9e96-69d793fef0cb.png)


* You will grow because of the results of your business,
* Every now and then you will grow from an acquisition
* e.g. Financial institutions like Citi, HSBC, etc
* The path of growth is very prodictable.

For regulators that is actually very useful, because regulators don't necessarily 
always regulate and enforce action against certain companies.

If you are between too small to care, and too large to ignore, regulators may o 
may not, at their own discretion, choose to enforce and action against you if you 
are breaching a rule. The reason of that is because not everything is worth suing 
for (if you are only having one or two consumers that you are hurting, this is not 
worth the regulator's time.

However, the problem is companies that become **too big to fail**. The notion of 
too big to fail is deeply rooted into the financial crisis, in the same way that 
the financial crisis has led to the emergence of FinTech. 

![threshold-point](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16638078/40890689-fe0dfbb4-6747-11e8-9444-454c7ad7f5bd.png)

But in a similar fashion, the emergence of mobile phone has also favorized the 
emergence of FinTech, and with it, the mobile phone is a distribution channel
for financial technology companies.

Because financial technology companies can use that infrastructure to more quickly 
reach you as a consumer, they can go from to small to care, to too big to fail 
overnight, creating a **Regulatory blind spot* for regulators.

![exponential-growth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16638078/40890823-2a696156-674a-11e8-9e10-876b930986a7.png)

This is the example in Chine with Yu'e Bao. Yu'e Bao went from zero to 90 billions 
US dollars of assets under management in only 9 months.

Therefore, **regulatory sandboxes** are one of the first tools for regulators
to resolve the risk created from startups that go from too small to care to big to fail,
but that's only the first step. The second step will be  about **building smart 
regulation** on top of regulatory sandboxes, and we will cover that topic in the 
RegTech module of this course.

#### Module 1 What is FinTech?  > 1.9 Introduction to Regulation  > Video 1.9: Introduction to Regulation


FinTech is the intersection of finance, technology and regulation.

Financial services, even before of 2008, was already one of the world's most heavily 
regulated industries. That is way when we think of FinTech, we need to think about 
regulation and the enviroment in which finance and technology operates.

And FinTech, because of the changes of new entrants, as well as the speed of 
technological development, poses a major challenges for policy makers in determining 
how best to regulate makerts in order to:
* Best achieve the objectives
* The opportunities of financial inclusion
* Democratisation of finance

While at the same time:
* Minimising the risks of both financial fraud, misconduct
* As well as financial crises.

If we think back to before of global financial crisis, regulators and policy maker 
tended to have a very positive attitude towards **financial innovation**. Things like:

* Credit derivative
* Credit default obligations
* Asset backed securities

![loans](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16638078/40891209-988612ce-674f-11e8-8dd2-427e37563086.png)

![asset-backed-securities](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16638078/40891235-e476dd76-674f-11e8-8027-be5a02d0a2b5.png)

All of which were financial innovations, but also brought new risks.

Because of global financial crisis, for the past 100 years, regulators and policymakers 
around the world have taken a very cautious approach to financial services regulations, 
focusing on building new costly regulatory frameworks to:
* Prevent crisis
* Prevent misconduct
* Protect customers

But at the same time, triggering development in FinTech. But this also make innovation 
more challenging and more difficult.

Over the past several years, as regulators have become mor comfortable with the 
opportunities and potential transformative developments taking place in FinTech, 
they have algo become more friendly from the standpoint fo regulation.

But from the standpoint of regulation, as we'll see throughout the rest of the course,
there's a continual process of **balancing objectives** like:
* Protecting consumers,
* Protecting the safety and soundness of the financial sector,
* Protecting against financial crises

with objectives of:
* Financial inclusion,
* Competition, i
* Innovation, 
* And development.

And it is this regulatory environment that much of fintech takes place in today.

### The Future of RegTech and 6 Technologies Impacting It (by Thomson Reuters)

> Hello. My name is Julia Walker. I'm the head of Market Development for
> Regulatory Technology across Asia-Pacific. So, what is RegTech? Well,
> I like to think about RegTech being FinTech's best friend, or at least
> the more sensible better half. Perhaps we can think about it this way:
> if FinTech is the rock star, RegTech is the band member happy to hang
> out in the background. However, RegTech has more recently started to
> take center-stage, usually increasing regulatory challenges in the
> financial sector, and the need to apply technology to solve them. As
> you'll see in this module, the future of RegTech is one of positive
> financial innovation, as well of benefits for financial regulation.
> It's the combination of both opening the door for the automation of
> regulation. In this module, we will show six new emerging
> technologies, and how these will redefine the future of RegTech. In
> module one, we provided you with a macro-trend of increased regulatory
> activity and enforcement since 2008. However now I wanted to help you
> with three simple illustrations to grasp the complexity behind
> regulatory adherence. As you can see in this graph, regulation is
> complex, voluminous and interconnected. When you understand that large
> tier one universal banks operate in over 60 jurisdictions, it's easier
> to picture the difficulty to comply globally. Especially with new
> rules having cross-jurisdictional affect such as GDPR. In addition,
> compliant obligations are always in a state of flux. Regulators'
> proactivity around the world can be seen by the number of regulatory
> changes. Regulatory alerts increased from 8,000 in 2008 to 56,000 in
> 2017, an average of 216 alerts per day. The global financial crisis of
> 2008 highlighted the systemic risk within the global financial system,
> serious conduct issues and a push to tighten anti-money laundering
> controls. Regulators in the United States and Europe have imposed 342
> billion in fines on banks for misconduct, including the violation of
> anti-money laundering rules, and it is likely to top 400 billion by
> 2020. And it's not just the fines causing headaches, conduct issues are also leading to revenue loss. A Hong Kong-based financial services
> company has estimated that bad behaviour has erased 850 billion in
> profits for the top 50 global banks. In New York, a 185 million dollar
> fine was issued for failing to protect client assets, and it's just
> not finances getting fined. RegTech can also help other industries
> especially when we know that regulatory enforcement is on the rise for
> corporates. 18 billion has been imposed to a car manufacturer, and 60
> million to a Japanese-based electronics company. On the backdrop of
> these macro changes in cost pressures is a number of new emerging
> technologies. In our discussion today, we want to look at some of the
> underlying trends that will shape the global financial system over the
> next 10 to 20 years, and remove the pain points associated with
> compliance obligations. Blockchain. Immutable, consensus driven,
> transparent, distributed, work flow enabled, and trust being replaced
> with truth. Blockchain could potentially power the identity market
> place and has the potential to modernise or even replace existing
> trading, clearing, and settlement operations. Smart contracts and
> smart oracles will exist to enable customers to use blockchain to
> streamline post-trade life-cycle, and other capital market use cases.
> Digitised assets with blockchain as a potential new way to digitise
> and maintain records for government and other relevant industries.
> Cognitive computing and artificial intelligence. We are just at the
> beginning of a revolution that will touch every business, and every
> life on this planet. The data volumes are exploding. More data has
> been created in the past two years than in the entire previous history
> of the human race. At the moment however, less than 0.5% of all data
> is ever analysed and used. As this quantum of data grows the need for
> standards, structure and integration does also. The need for smart
> machines to synthesise and make sense of data and support the human
> cognitive and decision-making process is therefore paramount. The
> internet of things. Electronic sensors are showing up in devices all
> around the world. We now have self-driving cars that can navigate
> their way through traffic. Even regular cars track with AI in how fast
> they're going. But how can this enormous world of information
> generated by machines and sensors be used for better financial
> investment, trading decisions, and risk management? How can this data
> be aggregated and anonymized to protect individual privacy while
> retaining its most useful, actual information? Customers must have the
> confidence that their data is collected, stored, and used in a manner
> that benefits them, and does not jeopardise their privacy. Open source
> and API economy. APIs are fueling the customer-driven platform
> revolution. They're becoming a primary customer interface for
> technology-driven products and services, and a key channel for driving
> revenue and brand engagement. APIs are a set of rules that govern how
> one type of computer software communicates with another. They enable
> bank customers to share their personal financial information with
> third parties to generate opportunities for better deals on financial
> products and to use transaction data to access and compare products
> easily. From the bank's perspective, the technology enables them to
> remain competitive by providing them with opportunities to provide
> improved customer-friendly services and reach out to untapped markets.
> The Cloud. Everyone is looking at the Cloud, and for good reason.
> Cloud computing eliminates the capital expenditure of buying hardware
> and software and setting up and running on-site data centres. Big
> data. Firms need help organising and collecting enterprise and third
> party data to derive new insights. Data tagging allows investors,
> regulators and market participants to organise and analyse massive
> amounts of data and information more efficiently by associating pieces
> of information with keyword tags. The rapid changes and maturation of
> technologies from big data management to advanced analytics to machine
> learning, to artificial intelligence, and robotic process automation
> are fueling product innovation and providing customers potential
> opportunities to further transform operations. So there you go, six of
> the key technologies that you need to be aware of as we look at the
> future of RegTech but before I leave you, I wanted to highlight the
> three critical considerations to harness the value of innovation
> brought by RegTech. First, RegTech solutions need to be powered by
> trusted, structured and unstructured data that also has data mastering
> capability for effective integration with existing solutions. Second,
> advanced analytics and artificial intelligence will play a key role.
> And lastly, digital identity. Digital identity is a foundation to all
> RegTech solutions because identity of individual, organisation, or a
> physical asset are atomic in governance, regulatory compliance and
> risk-management solutions. We will cover this in more detail in module
> five.
