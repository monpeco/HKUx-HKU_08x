### Video 2.1 Module 2 Introduction


* Evolution of payments
* Payments within FinTech
* Technological developments

Payment is a critical feature of finance, payment has consistently been the largest 
sub-sector in terms of Venture Capital investment.

Not only this, but the media coverage has strongly covered the impact of e-money 
whether in Africa with M-Pesa and Alipay in China.

FinTech industry and B2B companies, payment represents an exception in many respect. 
This industry has many layers, and therefore clients and users.

Payment is unique in that we use it every day, in Europe alone, people are using 
their contactless card over 10 times every day.

Payment represents a very social element, from WeChat red-envelope connecting 
families thousands of miles apart to Venmo bill splitting feature which is 
changing the social stigma over requesting for cash.

You can imagine each of this course's module as a circle, with you at the center 
of the circle. You will easily relate to the one closest to you but also learn 
about the underlying infrastructure found in the more distant circles.

**The fist circle** is the closest to you, we will introduce **Paymment from a point 
of view of an individual** and how has evolved from Barter to Cash, from Cheques 
to Cards, and more reciently QR codes and Cryptocurrency.

**The second circle** looks at non-banks and telecom operators that have provided 
payment solution, leveraging on mobile phones and person-to-person networks they represent.

**The third circle** is composed of your bank and your government central bank. 
Traditionally a place where you have deposited your money, recent mandated changes
such as real-time-gross-settlement, RTGS, or PSD2 in Europe are opening opportunities
for new business models on how your money can be received, sent, or spent.

The fourth and final circle looks at the world, cross-border transaction and correspondent banking.
As individuals, you may have experienced cross-border payments in the context of remittance,
however, this only represents a very small fraction of the global financial transaction initiated
and settled through payment network such as Swift.

Finally, the payment module will open by introducing the development of a new payment stack
which has been made possible by the advancement of a new technology such as DLT, distributed 
ledger technology, but also increasingly being justified by recent risks identified in the 
payment rail system that is now over 50 years old.

### Module 2 Learning Objectives

Module 2 introduces the spectrum of electronic and other means of payment, from the traditional (cash) 
to the most recent (Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies). It highlights to learners the evolutionary context 
as well as the transformative role of new technologies in both traditional payments as well as alternative 
money and payment systems and the role of these in our daily lives and in our broader economies.

In Module 2, learners will:

* Consider the evolution of payment and money, from paper to digital to cryptocurrencies and beyond.
* Understand the underlying infrastructure of both traditional and new forms of payment.
* Understand how technology is transforming payment in developing countries and how it is changing payment in developed countries.
* Analyze the role of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in developing new means of money and payment.

#### Module 2 Payment, Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain   2.2 Individual Payment   Video 2.2 Individual Payments

### 1. barker

in 9000 BC,
up until 600 BC.
It was the one of barter.
People directly exchanged goods and services.
There was no money as a standard
or medium of exchange.

### 2. commodity money

With certain items being selected
to perform transaction.
For example, in 1100 BC,
China used small cast replicas
of goods, token, made out of bronze.
However, you may be more familiar with
example of other commodities being used,
such as silver or gold.


### 3. coinage

paper money starts to be introduced,
first in China, in the 700s,
and then in Europe,
with Sweden leading the way in the 17th century.
Paper money represents an example of
how technology, the printing press,
allowed to store varying amounts,
from one US dollar to 100 US dollar,
on the same size of paper.

This method is light and proved to be an advantage because you can pay with small bills instead of heavy bags of coins.


### 4. dematerialized payments

The dematerialization of payment
increased in speed and method
from the 1950s onward,
as technology has become more commoditized.
Payment was increasingly digital,
and the volume of non-cash transaction
has been steadily rising ever since.

* 1946, the first credit card is created with it before being popularised by card networks in the '50s.
* The chequebook is introduced about the same period.
* In 1980s, the ATM network becomes interconnected and global with millions of withdrawal points available.
* In the 1990s, the EMV standard creation allows to enhance security and data storage on cards.
* In 2000, mobile money provides a payment solution in developing countries, or banking services in developed nation.
* The dot-com period and the rise of internet and e-Commerce companies has started the trend of complete digitization of cash transaction. Plastic cards have been replaced by **e-wallets or virtual cards**.
* 2009, Bitcoin is created as a decentralised currency, stored across the internet.
* 2010, introduction of contactless cards and payments, which seven years later, are one of the most popular method of payment.
* 2015 onward, the popularisation of wearable devices, mobile wallets and cryptocurrencies continues.



Payment methods have changed and with it all behaviours.
From the Amazon supermarket without checkouts,
to Venmo true-value propositin of not being a bill splitting app,
but instead addressing the social stigma to request for money.

Predicting the future of payment is difficult, and it is not anymore 
linked just to money, but to technology itself, that is changing the methods
available to you.

Indeed, cryptocurrencies were not even considered less then a decade ago.

And even today, data is becoming the new oil and allowing a new type of barter system
where people are giving their personal information, in returns of goods and services.

#### Module 2 Payment, Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain   2.3 Developing Countries and DFS: The Story of Mobile Money   Video 2.3 Developing Countries and DFS: The Story of Mobile Money

### Video 2.3 Developing Countries and DFS: The Story of Mobile Money

the story of mobile money
and digital finance in developing countries.
I want to tell this story in terms of four questions.
What? Where? How? and Why?


What is mobile money?
Well, it's e-money.
It's an electronic credit on a mobile device
that represents a unit of real money
that typically sits in a trust account
in a commercial bank somewhere.
So, it's an electronic representation of paper money,


Where was it developed?
Well, it came about because one day,
telecommunications companies realised
that their software tracked in real time airtime credits.
They knew exactly how many minutes
a prepaid customer still had in credit,
and if they knew that,
they knew how many currency credits the customer had.
They realised this software could well adapted
to do the same thing.
And so, mobile money was born.

Initially, in a in a few countries,
including the Philippines,
but it achieved lift off in Kenya a decade ago in 2007.
It was a Vodafone product, M-Pesa,
and within three or four years,
the majority of Kenya's GDP was flowing
through M-Pesa every year.


The "How" question, how does it work?
Well, it's based on cash-in and cash-out agents
who are the same small shopkeepers who sell airtime.

So, a customer can walk in,
pass some cash across the counter,
and get a credit
some electronic money on their phone
that they can do things with,
that they couldn't so readily do with the paper money.

That's one way a credit comes about,
but the more often way is
the government makes a transfer payment,
a welfare payment directly to the phone,

Often, central banks will want
this service offered by their banks
because they trust the banks,
they know the banks,
they know how to regulate them.
But, banks around the world
are not typically good at providing services
to poor customers.
The entities that are already doing that
are the TELCOs.

The fourth question is,
why does it matter?
And it matters because without electronic money,
paying an electricity bill or a school bill
can require a parent to take the whole day off work,
travel for a few hours on a bus,
stand in a queue for a few hours,
travel a few hours home.
This is not typically transformative
for people who live in the capital city
or in the big cities,
it transforms the life of people
who live in the countryside
who don't have access to bricks and mortar branches.


The buzzword is **financial inclusion**.
It's about including these previously excluded people
in the financial services
and allowing them to do things more efficiently,

What are the challenges with it?
Well, it's worked well in east Africa.
Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda,
it's worked very well.
In other places, the record is more patchy.
In many countries,
governments transfer payments
to mobile money accounts,
people go to the cash-in and cash-out agent,
take the cash out, and then transact in cash.

That fails to realise most of the goals
of financial inclusion, you know,
they're not getting the efficiency benefits,
you're not getting the network effects,
you're not getting the vibrant ecosystem,
and it also causes a real problem for agents
because agents are mainly handing out cash,
and unless the other part of their business
provides them with a ready inflow of cash,
they're going to run out of cash often
and they're not going to be able
to meet redemption requests,
and then people get frustrated with the system.

#### Module 2 Payment, Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain  > 2.4 Developing Countries and DFS: Regulation of Mobile Money >  Video 2.4 Developing Countries and DFS: Regulation of Mobile Money

### Video 2.4 Developing Countries and DFS: Regulation of Mobile Money

the regulation of mobile money
and digital financial services in developing countries.
The first thing we need to do
with mobile money is keep it safe.

In **Common Law countries**,
this is relatively easy to do,
using the institution of a trust.

There's a trust deed,
either money is deposited
under that deed in a commercial bank,
and the deed provides for the role of a protector.
The protector will typically be the Central Bank,
although it could be somebody else. The Central as protector have the duty of
inspecting the trust arrangements
and insuring, most importantly,
that there is a 1:1 ratio
between issued electronic money
and actual money sitting in the trust account



In **Civil Law countries**, not so simple,
because usually the trust is not there.
But you can get to the same end
using a mix of mandates,
contracts, fiduciary contracts,
and sometimes direct regulation as needed.

There's no one size fits all solution
for Civil Law countries,
you need to craft a solution for each jurisdiction.

Once you've kept the float safe,
there's only two other, in my view,
core pieces of regulation you need.
One is Consumer Protection Regulation
and the other is Money Laundering
and Terrorism Financing Regulation.

An internation regime that could eventually see a country on a blacklist, if
it doesn't have adequate **AML (Anti-Money Laundering)** / **CTF (Counter-Terrorism Financing)**
regulation


And the important thing to do in dealing with that,
is to use proportional risk-based assessment.
In most poor countries
you are not going to be able to comply,
you're not going to be able to
reach the very highest standards of
Know-Your-Customer certification.
You're going to have to, you know, cut some corners
and decisions are going to have to be made.

**Consumer Protection** is
essential for the substantive reason
that without it,
people won't trust the system.
If people are losing their money,
they won't keep using it.
And mobile money and digital finance
needs network effects.
It needs a lot of people using it
so that it's beneficial for everybody.

The easy part for consumer protection is **rules**.
It's relatively easy to craft a good set of rules.
The difficult part is **recourse mechanisms**.
People have got to have some way
to get their problems solved.
And any effective recourse regime, in my view,
needs a free-to-call telephone number
that's manned a good number of hours a day
by someone with authority
to resolve customer problems.



The difference
between FinTech in rich countries
and digital finance in poor countries,

FinTechs in rich countries are typically startups.
They're young entrepreneurs seeking to get rich.

Digital Financial Services in poor countries are partly,
occasionally driven by that, but not so often.
They're mostly driven by government policy.
Governments have embraced
this idea of financial inclusion
and they're encouraging their banks
and their telcos to provide it.

So rich country regulators
are trialling regulatory sandboxes,
safe places in which entrepreneurs can take risks
with reduced licencing obligations,

And in some poor countries,
regulators are doing this,
but something much more is needed
of regulators in poor countries.
And that's a major mindshift,
a major change of perspective.

#### Module 2 Payment, Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain  > 2.5 RTGS System  > Video 2.5 RTGS Systems

### Video 2.5 RTGS Systems (Real Time Gross Settlement )

what is RTGS, or real-time gross settlement?
In short, it allows for transaction between banks
to happen in real time
and settle on a one-to-one basis.

This is to be contrasted with batch transaction
where banks settle the net amount owed
at a pre-determined interval
such as the end of the day or the week.

The necessity to move from
a batch to a real time world
is driven by two factors:

1. technological capacities,
2. customer expectation of instant delivery (As we move to mail to e-mail, we remove latency and cost to communicate, the same is expected in financial services)

Because RTGS systems
constitute a core component
of any national payment stack,
the reform process is slow
and once engaged,
takes decade to be fully implemented.


And whilst the majority of countries
have RTGS system in place,
a few more large players are still coming,
such as China and Australia.

How can RTGS support FinTech Innovation?

First, **peer-to-peer payment**.
The whole companies,
such as Venmo in the US,
that are facilitating payment transfer between individuals,
can only fully be successful
if real time payment actually happens.
if you were to split the bill with a friend,
however that bill splitting
and that request to a friend
would take one day or more to clear,
the gratification of being able
to receive the funds straightaway would not happen.


The second example is peer-to-peer lending.
RTGS is actually linked closely
to the development
of the peer-to-peer lending industry in the UK.
The funds would be available
for you to spend straightaway.
And for the capacity of the peer-to-peer lender
to make a bank-to-bank transfer instantly
as soon as the loan has been approved,
has only been made possible
because of real-time gross settlement.


RTGS represent a critical infrastructure layer
supporting FinTech innovation
even though you may not directly be aware of it
as it operates in the background
and serves as a payment rail.

#### Module 2 Payment, Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain   2.6 The ABCDs of Alternative Finance (Parts 1 & 2)   Video 2.6.1 The ABCDs of Alternative Finance (Part 1)

In his 2014 letter to JP Morgan's shareholders,
Jamie Dimon famously issued a warning
to its shareholders, employees
and even traditional competitors.

> Silicon Valley is coming.

At the bank's investor day
he added more colourfully:

> when I go to Silicon Valley,
> they all want to eat our lunch.
> Every single one of them is going to try.


During the last few years,
alternative finance is slowly transforming
the offering of financial services
and the providers of such services
in two main ways:
1. New business models
2. and new technologies

It's critical to understand
the four key and interrelated technologies
that have allowed alternative finance to flourish.
These can be known as the **ABCDs driving FinTech**,
namely:
1. artificial intelligence, or AI,
2. blockchain, 
3. cloud computing, 
4. and data.

### 1. Data

Banks have relied upon and generated
a tremendous amount of information.
These include information from and about customers,
their identity, their transactions,
their net worth
and even their relationships and location.

But this has been gathered in paper forms and not easibly searchable

The digitization of information means that such information can more easily be stored, transmited, searched, processed, analysed and displayed.

Customer data includes:
* **online behaviour** such as the time and location of logging in and transactions
* **other online activities** such as web browsing, e-commerce and social media use.
* Increasingly, **offline behaviour** is also being tracked through data from internet of things for IoT devices such as wearable smart watches,

### 2. Cloud computing

In the past, businesses such as financial institutions
had to build their IT systems
using different enterprise level software
that was developed or licenced
at high cost over time
and hosted on large servers on premises.
With the advent of cloud computing,
software resides at data centres on servers
run by companies dedicated managing such servers


Cloud computing also allowed
new business models to blossom.
Software as a service or SaaS businesses
bypass the traditional vendor model
of software development and sales
that require marketing software licences
at higher upfront fees

Software that resides in the cloud
can now be marketed at a lower upfront cost
based on a subscription model.
And software upgrades can be automatically
made on a continuous basis
which gives the client one less reason
to switch vendors.

In addition, the cloud
enables connected IoT devices
to gather data and stream more services
including financial services
to customers through new interfaces
like smart watches,
voice-activated speakers
and smart homes and smart cars.

#### Module 2 Payment, Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain   2.6 The ABCDs of Alternative Finance (Parts 1 & 2)   Video 2.6.2 The ABCDs of Alternative Finance (Part 2)

### 2. Blockchain

Distributed ledger technology or DLT
continues to have an evolving impact
on alternative finance.

The oldest example of double-entry bookkeeping
can be found in the publication in 1494
of Franciscan Friar Luca Pacioli
which allowed for reliable documentation
of both creditor and debtor
in a standardised manner.

The white paper on Bitcoin
by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008
was similarly revolutionary
in establishing a cryptocurrency that seeks to solve
the double spending problem
intrinsic in a currency
based on software without the need
of a trusted authority or central server.

Nakamoto postulated a ledger that is distributed
via a peer-to-peer network
which records transactions
by way of blocks.
Each block is validated
by different node computers in the network
through solving cryptographic mathematical puzzles,
or hashes, at which time a new block
with a new cryptographic hash,
timestamp, and data would be added to the chain
which is transparent to all users.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16638078/41197210-d0b39300-6c23-11e8-9e1f-1cda5c179058.png)

Data on the block is immutable
and effectively cannot be altered
unless all prior blocks in the chain
are altered by consensus
or agreement of the network majority.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16638078/41197211-ed828932-6c23-11e8-8372-084262a5d974.png)


Blockchain is the underlying technology
behind cryptocurrencies
that have expanded dramatically beyond Bitcoin.
In this way,
this technology has created
a new form of digital asset
as well as a new alternative finance method
to raise capital for new projects,
with the so-called crypto exchanges
comprising new forms of online capital marketplaces.

* In addition, blockchain technology could form
the basis of new capital markets infrastructure.
NASDAQ is using blockchain technologies
to secure record keeping of ownership
of private companies and transfers.

* In December 2017,
Australia's ASX announced that it would replace
its stock exchange registry,
settlement and clearing system
with blockchain technology.

* An even more ambitious use of blockchain technology
through the creation
of distributed autonomous organisations or DAOs
that allow for automatic execution
upon specific conditions
via smart contracts,
with innovative governance mechanisms
based on direct voting and consensus.

If implemented to its fullest extent,
DAOs and its efforts to disintermediate
could impact not only the venture capital market
but also the very concept of the joint stock company
and even some functions of government.

### 4. Artificial intelligence

The term artificial intelligence was coined
at the now famous Dartmouth summer research workshop in 1955.


Two initial clarifications would be helpful: 
* First, it should be noted that
we refer to the **narrow** or **weak AI**
that relates to algorithm performing specific tasks,
as opposed to general or strong AI
that reflect broader human intelligence
and decision-making.

* Second, there are different strands within AI,
including Natural Language Processing or NLP
which relates to language, often written,
and Machine Learning where
systems learn from experience
by being trained with data
as opposed to being rules-based.

There are many techniques within Machine Learning,
including neural networks which comprise
nodes of weighted interconnectedness
inspired by the human brain, and deep learning,
which refers to algorithms based on neural networks
arranged in deeper layers.

After a long so-called AI winter of lacklustre activity,
AI has blossomed due to
a confluence of events
that made both Fortune and Forbes
name 2017 the year of AI.

First, instead of expensive large supercomputers
required for the AI algorithmic processing,
researchers started using
relatively cheap graphical processing units or GPUs
originally developed for video games
with increased computational power
when used in parallel.

Second, data storage cost continues to fall
while data is being gathering at alarming rates
through online activity and connected devices,
thereby allowing for
more structured and unstructured data
to be gathered, stored, and used
to train the machines.

Third, most major cloud companies,
such as Amazon's AWS, Google Cloud,
Microsoft's Azure, IBM Cloud
and Alibaba's Aliyun
incorporate AI into their services,
often including machine learning frameworks
on some open source basis
to allow their clients to experiment
and incorporate into their operations.
