### Video 2.1 Module 2 Introduction


* Evolution of payments
* Payments within FinTech
* Technological developments

Payment is a critical feature of finance, payment has consistently been the largest 
sub-sector in terms of Venture Capital investment.

Not only this, but the media coverage has strongly covered the impact of e-money 
whether in Africa with M-Pesa and Alipay in China.

FinTech industry and B2B companies, payment represents an exception in many respect. 
This industry has many layers, and therefore clients and users.

Payment is unique in that we use it every day, in Europe alone, people are using 
their contactless card over 10 times every day.

Payment represents a very social element, from WeChat red-envelope connecting 
families thousands of miles apart to Venmo bill splitting feature which is 
changing the social stigma over requesting for cash.

You can imagine each of this course's module as a circle, with you at the center 
of the circle. You will easily relate to the one closest to you but also learn 
about the underlying infrastructure found in the more distant circles.

**The fist circle** is the closest to you, we will introduce **Paymment from a point 
of view of an individual** and how has evolved from Barter to Cash, from Cheques 
to Cards, and more reciently QR codes and Cryptocurrency.

**The second circle** looks at non-banks and telecom operators that have provided 
payment solution, leveraging on mobile phones and person-to-person networks they represent.

**The third circle** is composed of your bank and your government central bank. 
Traditionally a place where you have deposited your money, recent mandated changes
such as real-time-gross-settlement, RTGS, or PSD2 in Europe are opening opportunities
for new business models on how your money can be received, sent, or spent.

The fourth and final circle looks at the world, cross-border transaction and correspondent banking.
As individuals, you may have experienced cross-border payments in the context of remittance,
however, this only represents a very small fraction of the global financial transaction initiated
and settled through payment network such as Swift.

Finally, the payment module will open by introducing the development of a new payment stack
which has been made possible by the advancement of a new technology such as DLT, distributed 
ledger technology, but also increasingly being justified by recent risks identified in the 
payment rail system that is now over 50 years old.

### Module 2 Learning Objectives

Module 2 introduces the spectrum of electronic and other means of payment, from the traditional (cash) 
to the most recent (Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies). It highlights to learners the evolutionary context 
as well as the transformative role of new technologies in both traditional payments as well as alternative 
money and payment systems and the role of these in our daily lives and in our broader economies.

In Module 2, learners will:

* Consider the evolution of payment and money, from paper to digital to cryptocurrencies and beyond.
* Understand the underlying infrastructure of both traditional and new forms of payment.
* Understand how technology is transforming payment in developing countries and how it is changing payment in developed countries.
* Analyze the role of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in developing new means of money and payment.

### 1. barker

in 9000 BC,
up until 600 BC.
It was the one of barter.
People directly exchanged goods and services.
There was no money as a standard
or medium of exchange.

### 2. commodity money

With certain items being selected
to perform transaction.
For example, in 1100 BC,
China used small cast replicas
of goods, token, made out of bronze.
However, you may be more familiar with
example of other commodities being used,
such as silver or gold.


### 3. coinage

paper money starts to be introduced,
first in China, in the 700s,
and then in Europe,
with Sweden leading the way in the 17th century.
Paper money represents an example of
how technology, the printing press,
allowed to store varying amounts,
from one US dollar to 100 US dollar,
on the same size of paper.

This method is light and proved to be an advantage because you can pay with small bills instead of heavy bags of coins.


### 4. dematerialized payments

The dematerialization of payment
increased in speed and method
from the 1950s onward,
as technology has become more commoditized.
Payment was increasingly digital,
and the volume of non-cash transaction
has been steadily rising ever since.

* 1946, the first credit card is created with it before being popularised by card networks in the '50s.
* The chequebook is introduced about the same period.
* In 1980s, the ATM network becomes interconnected and global with millions of withdrawal points available.
* In the 1990s, the EMV standard creation allows to enhance security and data storage on cards.
* In 2000, mobile money provides a payment solution in developing countries, or banking services in developed nation.
* The dot-com period and the rise of internet and e-Commerce companies has started the trend of complete digitization of cash transaction. Plastic cards have been replaced by **e-wallets or virtual cards**.
* 2009, Bitcoin is created as a decentralised currency, stored across the internet.
* 2010, introduction of contactless cards and payments, which seven years later, are one of the most popular method of payment.
* 2015 onward, the popularisation of wearable devices, mobile wallets and cryptocurrencies continues.



Payment methods have changed and with it all behaviours.
From the Amazon supermarket without checkouts,
to Venmo true-value propositin of not being a bill splitting app,
but instead addressing the social stigma to request for money.

Predicting the future of payment is difficult, and it is not anymore 
linked just to money, but to technology itself, that is changing the methods
available to you.

Indeed, cryptocurrencies were not even considered less then a decade ago.

And even today, data is becoming the new oil and allowing a new type of barter system
where people are giving their personal information, in returns of goods and services.

### Video 2.3 Developing Countries and DFS: The Story of Mobile Money

the story of mobile money
and digital finance in developing countries.
I want to tell this story in terms of four questions.
What? Where? How? and Why?


What is mobile money?
Well, it's e-money.
It's an electronic credit on a mobile device
that represents a unit of real money
that typically sits in a trust account
in a commercial bank somewhere.
So, it's an electronic representation of paper money,


Where was it developed?
Well, it came about because one day,
telecommunications companies realised
that their software tracked in real time airtime credits.
They knew exactly how many minutes
a prepaid customer still had in credit,
and if they knew that,
they knew how many currency credits the customer had.
They realised this software could well adapted
to do the same thing.
And so, mobile money was born.

Initially, in a in a few countries,
including the Philippines,
but it achieved lift off in Kenya a decade ago in 2007.
It was a Vodafone product, M-Pesa,
and within three or four years,
the majority of Kenya's GDP was flowing
through M-Pesa every year.


The "How" question, how does it work?
Well, it's based on cash-in and cash-out agents
who are the same small shopkeepers who sell airtime.

So, a customer can walk in,
pass some cash across the counter,
and get a credit
some electronic money on their phone
that they can do things with,
that they couldn't so readily do with the paper money.

That's one way a credit comes about,
but the more often way is
the government makes a transfer payment,
a welfare payment directly to the phone,

Often, central banks will want
this service offered by their banks
because they trust the banks,
they know the banks,
they know how to regulate them.
But, banks around the world
are not typically good at providing services
to poor customers.
The entities that are already doing that
are the TELCOs.

The fourth question is,
why does it matter?
And it matters because without electronic money,
paying an electricity bill or a school bill
can require a parent to take the whole day off work,
travel for a few hours on a bus,
stand in a queue for a few hours,
travel a few hours home.
This is not typically transformative
for people who live in the capital city
or in the big cities,
it transforms the life of people
who live in the countryside
who don't have access to bricks and mortar branches.


The buzzword is **financial inclusion**.
It's about including these previously excluded people
in the financial services
and allowing them to do things more efficiently,

What are the challenges with it?
Well, it's worked well in east Africa.
Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda,
it's worked very well.
In other places, the record is more patchy.
In many countries,
governments transfer payments
to mobile money accounts,
people go to the cash-in and cash-out agent,
take the cash out, and then transact in cash.

That fails to realise most of the goals
of financial inclusion, you know,
they're not getting the efficiency benefits,
you're not getting the network effects,
you're not getting the vibrant ecosystem,
and it also causes a real problem for agents
because agents are mainly handing out cash,
and unless the other part of their business
provides them with a ready inflow of cash,
they're going to run out of cash often
and they're not going to be able
to meet redemption requests,
and then people get frustrated with the system.
