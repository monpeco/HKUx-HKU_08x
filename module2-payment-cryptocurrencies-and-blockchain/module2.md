### Video 2.1 Module 2 Introduction


* Evolution of payments
* Payments within FinTech
* Technological developments

Payment is a critical feature of finance, payment has consistently been the largest 
sub-sector in terms of Venture Capital investment.

Not only this, but the media coverage has strongly covered the impact of e-money 
whether in Africa with M-Pesa and Alipay in China.

FinTech industry and B2B companies, payment represents an exception in many respect. 
This industry has many layers, and therefore clients and users.

Payment is unique in that we use it every day, in Europe alone, people are using 
their contactless card over 10 times every day.

Payment represents a very social element, from WeChat red-envelope connecting 
families thousands of miles apart to Venmo bill splitting feature which is 
changing the social stigma over requesting for cash.

You can imagine each of this course's module as a circle, with you at the center 
of the circle. You will easily relate to the one closest to you but also learn 
about the underlying infrastructure found in the more distant circles.

**The fist circle** is the closest to you, we will introduce **Paymment from a point 
of view of an individual** and how has evolved from Barter to Cash, from Cheques 
to Cards, and more reciently QR codes and Cryptocurrency.

**The second circle** looks at non-banks and telecom operators that have provided 
payment solution, leveraging on mobile phones and person-to-person networks they represent.

**The third circle** is composed of your bank and your government central bank. 
Traditionally a place where you have deposited your money, recent mandated changes
such as real-time-gross-settlement, RTGS, or PSD2 in Europe are opening opportunities
for new business models on how your money can be received, sent, or spent.

The fourth and final circle looks at the world, cross-border transaction and correspondent banking.
As individuals, you may have experienced cross-border payments in the context of remittance,
however, this only represents a very small fraction of the global financial transaction initiated
and settled through payment network such as Swift.

Finally, the payment module will open by introducing the development of a new payment stack
which has been made possible by the advancement of a new technology such as DLT, distributed 
ledger technology, but also increasingly being justified by recent risks identified in the 
payment rail system that is now over 50 years old.

### 1. barker

in 9000 BC,
up until 600 BC.
It was the one of barter.
People directly exchanged goods and services.
There was no money as a standard
or medium of exchange.

### 2. commodity money

With certain items being selected
to perform transaction.
For example, in 1100 BC,
China used small cast replicas
of goods, token, made out of bronze.
However, you may be more familiar with
example of other commodities being used,
such as silver or gold.


### 3. coinage

paper money starts to be introduced,
first in China, in the 700s,
and then in Europe,
with Sweden leading the way in the 17th century.
Paper money represents an example of
how technology, the printing press,
allowed to store varying amounts,
from one US dollar to 100 US dollar,
on the same size of paper.

This method is light and proved to be an advantage because you can pay with small bills instead of heavy bags of coins.


### 4. dematerialized payments

The dematerialization of payment
increased in speed and method
from the 1950s onward,
as technology has become more commoditized.
Payment was increasingly digital,
and the volume of non-cash transaction
has been steadily rising ever since.

* 1946, the first credit card is created with it before being popularised by card networks in the '50s.
* The chequebook is introduced about the same period.
* In 1980s, the ATM network becomes interconnected and global with millions of withdrawal points available.
* In the 1990s, the EMV standard creation allows to enhance security and data storage on cards.
* In 2000, mobile money provides a payment solution in developing countries, or banking services in developed nation.
* The dot-com period and the rise of internet and e-Commerce companies has started the trend of complete digitization of cash transaction. Plastic cards have been replaced by **e-wallets or virtual cards**.
* 2009, Bitcoin is created as a decentralised currency, stored across the internet.
* 2010, introduction of contactless cards and payments, which seven years later, are one of the most popular method of payment.
* 2015 onward, the popularisation of wearable devices, mobile wallets and cryptocurrencies continues.



Payment methods have changed and with it all behaviours.
From the Amazon supermarket without checkouts,
to Venmo true-value propositin of not being a bill splitting app,
but instead addressing the social stigma to request for money.

Predicting the future of payment is difficult, and it is not anymore 
linked just to money, but to technology itself, that is changing the methods
available to you.

Indeed, cryptocurrencies were not even considered less then a decade ago.

And even today, data is becoming the new oil and allowing a new type of barter system
where people are giving their personal information, in returns of goods and services.
