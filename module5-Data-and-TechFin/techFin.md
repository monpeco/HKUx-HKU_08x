Welcome back to the HKU FinTech course.
You are now in module 5,
and we'll be talking about data.
As you may know, data is the new oil,
and what this means is that it becomes
an increasingly valuable commodity both for you
as individuals, financial institutions,
or technology companies.
In this module, we will be covering
each of these aspects.
First, we're going to be talking to you as an individual.
How is GDPR in Europe
covering and impacting businesses
as well as you as an individual?
What about digital identity?

How a piece of password can now be condensed
in a piece of data,
and how that piece of data
can better define who you are,
and therefore customise experiences around you.
We'll then be also looking
at the financial services industry.
They have been using data since the 1970s,
and have been able to deliver new financial products
on the back of this.
However, there is challenge on doing so at scale.
Startups and the FinTech transformation
is also one which is underlied by the use
of technology and data accessibility
both by technology companies
as well as the financial institutions.
On the technology company side,
we'll be talking about the challenges
brought by TechFin companies,
as well as the governments of AI.
And finally, regulators.
The increased value of data means
that more and more people want to
access it by legal and illegal means.
And therefore, the regulation of data
from a data privacy perspective,
or the protection of data
from a technological perspective,
will also be addressed in this module.

#### Module 5 Data & TechFin   5.1 Module 5 Introduction   Module 5 Learning Objectives

Module 5 discusses data, data regulation, data security and the emergence of TechFin. In focuses on both the opportunities as well as the risks and challenges arising from the process of digitization and datafication in finance, as well as policy and regulatory approaches and their implications for business.    

In Module 5, learners will:

* Understand the role of data in financial services
* Consider various approaches to data protection and privacy
* Think about the challenges of digitization and datafication, particularly cybersecurity and technological risk
* Discuss the emergence of TechFins and the implications for financial services

#### Module 5 Data & TechFin   5.2 History of Data Regulation   Video 5.2 History of Data Regulation

When looking at data
and how it has been regulated over time,
there's different elements to it.
First, we can approach data from a privacy perspective.
A lot of you can relate to this
when we look at data breaches that infects
your personal information being released to the public.
What has been happening with Facebook
and how that data, for example,
has been used in the context of political elections,
both in the US and in Europe.

Data privacy matters
because it's all about protecting your personal life,
and that life is increasingly now online.
The second element is about
cross-border data management,
and whilst digitization is a global phenomenon,
cross-border data management
is not necessarily something
which is as automatic than one may think,
and there's some right reason to do so.
Certain jurisdictions are, for example,
much more stringent about data residency rules,
where data can only be held and stored
in a single country and not leave it.
This is one of the big problem for FinTech companies.

Whilst FinTech companies have global ambition,
data regulation, especially on how
cross-border data management is done,
can be a real limiting factor for their ambition of growth.
Why? Because for example, a regulator in a Country A
may not want that the data of its consumer
transferred to Country B where it will be processed
and then the insight brought back to Country A.
This can be for many different reasons,
including national sovereignty and national security.

Since 2007, the financial crisis has shown
that financial services stability
is a national sovereignty issue, and as a result,
data residency and data protection is equally important.
The third element is data management.
This is how people will access and control their data.
One of the topic that, for example,
we've covered in Module 4 was GDPR,
and here it's about this idea that
every single piece of data
should be able to be traced back
to its individual owner, if it identified him.
And if it does, that owner should have the right
of querying the institution who has seen that data,
how many times the data has been used,
and how the data is actually being used,
and in which countries.
This is the idea of data that could be accounted
as a liability or an asset, from a financial perspective.

However, from all perspective,
data and its regulation
should be looked from another angle.
It should be looked from an angle
where data equals money,
and all the rights and obligation attributed to it
should be similar to money.
Data would therefore have a property right,
a commercial right,
and that can be transferred, exchanged, borrowed,
or leased to someone else.
And this matters a lot.
It matters because it will allow digital identity
and data sovereignty to keep on growing as an industry.
It also matters because as the economy
is going from a service economy to a digital economy,
more and more individuals will be looking at ways
of monetising their data to supplement,
if not totally replace their income.

So far, this topic of data regulation hasn't emerged yet
because the money that can be made
from data monetisation
has not passed the poverty line.
However, when this will happen,
a real question will be raised
at the regulatory and the policy level
on how that data regulation should be approached.
From a trend perspective,
we can imagine that this will mainly
happen in countries like Asia.
This is because, proportionally,
the value of data from an individual in Asia
is higher compared to their salary
to what you would have in Europe.
For example, someone in Vietnam
earning 8,000 US dollar a year,
but having their data worth 50 US dollar a year,
has a higher value as a proportion
of their data to their salary,
compared to a European person
earning 50,000 US dollars a year,
but only having 50 US dollar worth of data.
This is why the future of data regulation
and data being treated as money
is mainly going to come from places like Asia.
However, so far, the regulatory tempo
has clearly been set by Europe,
which has one of the most stringent and complete
regulatory regime around data management,
which is followed across the world and including Asia.
