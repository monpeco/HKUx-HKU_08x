Welcome back to the HKU FinTech course.
You are now in module 5,
and we'll be talking about data.
As you may know, data is the new oil,
and what this means is that it becomes
an increasingly valuable commodity both for you
as individuals, financial institutions,
or technology companies.
In this module, we will be covering
each of these aspects.
First, we're going to be talking to you as an individual.
How is GDPR in Europe
covering and impacting businesses
as well as you as an individual?
What about digital identity?

How a piece of password can now be condensed
in a piece of data,
and how that piece of data
can better define who you are,
and therefore customise experiences around you.
We'll then be also looking
at the financial services industry.
They have been using data since the 1970s,
and have been able to deliver new financial products
on the back of this.
However, there is challenge on doing so at scale.
Startups and the FinTech transformation
is also one which is underlied by the use
of technology and data accessibility
both by technology companies
as well as the financial institutions.
On the technology company side,
we'll be talking about the challenges
brought by TechFin companies,
as well as the governments of AI.
And finally, regulators.
The increased value of data means
that more and more people want to
access it by legal and illegal means.
And therefore, the regulation of data
from a data privacy perspective,
or the protection of data
from a technological perspective,
will also be addressed in this module.

#### Module 5 Data & TechFin   5.1 Module 5 Introduction   Module 5 Learning Objectives

Module 5 discusses data, data regulation, data security and the emergence of TechFin. In focuses on both the opportunities as well as the risks and challenges arising from the process of digitization and datafication in finance, as well as policy and regulatory approaches and their implications for business.    

In Module 5, learners will:

* Understand the role of data in financial services
* Consider various approaches to data protection and privacy
* Think about the challenges of digitization and datafication, particularly cybersecurity and technological risk
* Discuss the emergence of TechFins and the implications for financial services

#### Module 5 Data & TechFin   5.2 History of Data Regulation   Video 5.2 History of Data Regulation

When looking at data
and how it has been regulated over time,
there's different elements to it.
First, we can approach data from a privacy perspective.
A lot of you can relate to this
when we look at data breaches that infects
your personal information being released to the public.
What has been happening with Facebook
and how that data, for example,
has been used in the context of political elections,
both in the US and in Europe.

Data privacy matters
because it's all about protecting your personal life,
and that life is increasingly now online.
The second element is about
cross-border data management,
and whilst digitization is a global phenomenon,
cross-border data management
is not necessarily something
which is as automatic than one may think,
and there's some right reason to do so.
Certain jurisdictions are, for example,
much more stringent about data residency rules,
where data can only be held and stored
in a single country and not leave it.
This is one of the big problem for FinTech companies.

Whilst FinTech companies have global ambition,
data regulation, especially on how
cross-border data management is done,
can be a real limiting factor for their ambition of growth.
Why? Because for example, a regulator in a Country A
may not want that the data of its consumer
transferred to Country B where it will be processed
and then the insight brought back to Country A.
This can be for many different reasons,
including national sovereignty and national security.

Since 2007, the financial crisis has shown
that financial services stability
is a national sovereignty issue, and as a result,
data residency and data protection is equally important.
The third element is data management.
This is how people will access and control their data.
One of the topic that, for example,
we've covered in Module 4 was GDPR,
and here it's about this idea that
every single piece of data
should be able to be traced back
to its individual owner, if it identified him.
And if it does, that owner should have the right
of querying the institution who has seen that data,
how many times the data has been used,
and how the data is actually being used,
and in which countries.
This is the idea of data that could be accounted
as a liability or an asset, from a financial perspective.

However, from all perspective,
data and its regulation
should be looked from another angle.
It should be looked from an angle
where data equals money,
and all the rights and obligation attributed to it
should be similar to money.
Data would therefore have a property right,
a commercial right,
and that can be transferred, exchanged, borrowed,
or leased to someone else.
And this matters a lot.
It matters because it will allow digital identity
and data sovereignty to keep on growing as an industry.
It also matters because as the economy
is going from a service economy to a digital economy,
more and more individuals will be looking at ways
of monetising their data to supplement,
if not totally replace their income.

So far, this topic of data regulation hasn't emerged yet
because the money that can be made
from data monetisation
has not passed the poverty line.
However, when this will happen,
a real question will be raised
at the regulatory and the policy level
on how that data regulation should be approached.
From a trend perspective,
we can imagine that this will mainly
happen in countries like Asia.
This is because, proportionally,
the value of data from an individual in Asia
is higher compared to their salary
to what you would have in Europe.
For example, someone in Vietnam
earning 8,000 US dollar a year,
but having their data worth 50 US dollar a year,
has a higher value as a proportion
of their data to their salary,
compared to a European person
earning 50,000 US dollars a year,
but only having 50 US dollar worth of data.
This is why the future of data regulation
and data being treated as money
is mainly going to come from places like Asia.
However, so far, the regulatory tempo
has clearly been set by Europe,
which has one of the most stringent and complete
regulatory regime around data management,
which is followed across the world and including Asia.

#### Module 5 Data & TechFin   5.3 Data in Financial Services   Video 5.3 Data in Financial Services

The importance of data in the economy
has been captured by Professor Klaus Schwab,
executive chairman of the World Economic Forum.
His analysis entails that the world
is entering a fourth industrial revolution
powered by artificial intelligence
and being distinguished
in its characteristic of hyper scalability,
which we will discuss more in module 6.
Importantly, the fourth industrial revolution
has been built on top of the third era,
which started in the 1970s,
thanks to computer and automation.
As we have seen throughout this course,
technological progress
and financial market development
have a close relationship.
Professor Schwab's third era
of computer and automation coincides
with the digitization of financial services,
which we discussed in module three.

And in this lecture, we are instead
projecting ourself forward,
aiming to answer the following questions.
**How can the data created since the 1970s
be used meaningfully in financial services?**
And **what does the fourth industrial revolution look like
for financial markets?**

The importance lies in the fact
that as with any large economic shift,
the relationship of money
and power is being redistributed.
As such, answering if financial institutions need
to become data companies matters.
Should their business model move
towards a data refining instead
of interest or fee-based income?
In order to find answers,
we will present three examples
in exploring in turns, big data,
artificial intelligence, and analytics tools.

Let's start with the **hedge funds** industry.
They have historically been distinguishing themselves
by their capacity of using quantitative skills
and hiring a lot of Math scientists.
They have increasingly been leveraging
an external and new alternative data
to make better investment decisions.
For example, the use of geolocation data
was used to estimate the footfall
in shopping malls, and therefore predict
the growth of sales ahead of public quarterly reports,
allowing to make an investment decision
before public information is out.

In the context of the **insurance industry**,
we have seen usage-based insurance changing
the current flat-fee insurance model
and instead moving towards
a pay-as-you-go service
centred around your lifestyle.
This has been made possible by the increase
of telematic solutions,
such as trackers in your car,
or your mobile phone,
which is then analysed for better pricing.
Here, data is being used
to change the underwriting decision model
whilst becoming the most cost-effective option
for you as a customer.

Finally, in **banking**,
by using predictive analytics,
a bank is able to monitor the spending patterns
of a consumer, and then
infer if a larger purchase will be made.
The size of that purchase will then define whether
the bank should proactively propose
a consumer loan or mortgage.
Likewise, a very simple example
is taking a travel insurance as soon as
you buy a plane ticket with your credit card.

Now, these examples illustrate that data
has previously been used in financial services,
but this has not been equally done by all.
This is mainly due to the fact
that data today remains a by-product
of activity as opposed to a core asset that is valued.
To make this change across the industry,
new C-level roles are emerging,
such as Chief Data Officer.
Regulators are also concerned by this,
and you saw that in module 4
when we were covering the topic of smart regulation
and what it means from a human capital perspective
for the regulators.

Now, in order to enhance the value of data,
whether internal or external,
going forward, financial institution will need
to consider the three Vs of data.

First, **volume**.
The combination of behaviour tracking
and Internet of Things is increasing
the amount of data points available.

Second, **velocity**.
The speed at which data is created requires
the need for real time analytics,
as it challenges the current storage capacity.

Third, **variety**.
The ability to handle,
understand structured and unstructured data
from internal or external sources.

As this transformation process occurs,
FinTech startups are increasingly providing
the necessary analytical tools to process
and analyse data held by financial institutions.
For now, these remain narrow use cases
and include identification of credit risk
in loan portfolio, transaction of quarterly reports
into investment advise,
or performing complete audit risk review.
Whilst these have always been performed by banks,
today the combination of data availability
and analytical tools make it possible
to do these in seconds instead of hours,
and this is done without a trade-off on accuracy levels.
Hopefully, this will provide banks a capacity
to restore profitability levels,
whilst for consumer,
create a new era of invisible finance,
one that support your lifestyle instead
of creating friction as you're trying
to achieve your goals.

#### Module 5 Data & TechFin   Industry Showcase: Application of Data Analytics in Finance (vPhrase)   Industry Showcase: Application of Data Analytics in Finance

Hello everyone, I'm Neerav Parekh.
I'm the founder of a company called vPhrase.
We're from India.
I'll tell you about how AI
is being used in the data analytics space
for FinTech companies.
So, we created a product that a lot of institutions use
for improving their report.
Let me give you a few examples.
Motilal Oswal which is one of the largest brokerages,
they use a platform for creating portfolio analysis
for their investors,
so we examine 500,000 portfolios every month
and create statements for the investors.
The whole idea is to give them
the key insights in the portfolio, using language.
So, AI is being used to generate language from data
to explain all the insights to the leader.
So, that is one example.

Another large very large private bank in India
is using our platform to create personalised reports
for the branch managers,
so the whole performance of the branch,
all the data is taken in,
is analysed and language is written
to explain to the branch manager
how exactly is this branch doing.
So, a few bullet points we'll tell him,
Ok if your branch's achieving its targets,
which products that are doing well,
which products that are not doing well and so on.

Then there's another large investment bank
which is using our platform
for risk analysis of stocks and mutual funds.
So, they study the performance of mutual funds,
they study the performance of companies
and we use that data to create risk analysis reports
for them on those stocks and mutual funds.
So, as you'll see,
we're using AI for data analysis
and then creating language,
natural language generation,
so that people can understand the data better.
Enterprises can make their reports
easier to understand for their people.
Thank you.

#### Module 5 Data & TechFin   5.4 European Big-Bang: PSD2 / GDPR / Mifid2   Video 5.4: European Big-Bang: PSD2 / GDPR / Mifid2

We've seen across this course
how technology has transformed finance,
and in particular, we've seen how finance
has transformed finance in China,
perhaps more so than any other place in the world,
how firms such as Ali Baba and Tencent
and their financial subsidiaries like
Ant Financial and WeBank
have led a digital transformation,
driving finance in China
from a cash-based, bank-based system
to one which is based largely on data and technology,
digital forms of payment,
digital forms of lending,
digital forms of investment,
all based upon techniques of automation,
big data, and increasingly, artificial intelligence
to build a framework
for an entirely new 21st-century form of finance.
We've also seen in the context of India
how India has been seeking
to build a digital infrastructure
to support the transformation of its financial system.

Likewise, in the European Union,
a series of changes coming into effect in 2018
are fundamentally transforming the relationship
between finance and data, setting the stage
for a new European financial system
not based on monetization of finance,
but rather on monetization of data.
And these three pieces go by
the short names of GDPR, PSD2, and MiFID II,
three rather uninteresting strings of letters,
but fundamentally transforming the way
that finance and data relate in the context of the EU.

### GDPR General Data Protection Regulation

and this has evolved out of a long process of building
a legal framework for privacy
and data protection in the EU.

* GDPR is fundamentally about giving individuals power and control over their individual personal data.
* It allows individuals to direct holders of their personal data to delete it, forget it, transfer it, and in any way that it is the data of the individual,
rather than the data of the company, of the firm.

And this is fundamentally transforming the way
that businesses think about their relationship
to their customer and their data.
This in particular is a big challenge for tech firms
like Google or Facebook or Ali Baba or Tencent.


### PSD2 the Payment Services Directive 2.

PSD2 sets new rules to allow open entry of a wide range
of new entrants to the payments industry.
But beyond allowing
an increasing range of new entrants
and encouraging digitization
and transparency of payments,
PSD2 also creates a series
of requirements for open banking.
In other words, for a customer,
if a bank has your data,
information about your financial history,
your financial transactions, your financial accounts,
PSD2 requires those banks,
if you so direct, to allow
third parties access to your data, to your accounts.
And this fundamentally sets
a framework for banks' business
being transformed as customers' data and access
to their accounts is no longer under the control
of banks and other financial institutions,
but it is open to new entrants,
new startups, new tech firms,
all of which are gaining access to massive
amounts of data under the control
of the individual consumer,
rather than the financial institution.

### MiFID II Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II.

MiFID II is an initiative that has evolved
out of the 2008 global financial crisis.
It is fundamentally about creating **greater transparency**
in the formal financial markets,
markets for bonds, shares, derivatives, and the like,
whether those are traded on exchange or off exchange.
And amongst many other things,
it requires the **reporting of all transactions
relating to EU financial instruments**,
like bonds or shares or derivatives, whether or not
those transactions take place on or off exchange.
In terms of total size, it has grown to be
more than 1.7 million paragraphs in length,
7,000 printed pages of regulations,
which have required financial institutions to spend
literally tens of billions of dollars in
building new systems
to meet its reporting requirements.

Each of these systems,
PSD2, GDPR, and MiFID II,
were all designed for specific reasons.
But no one thought about what would happen
when you combined them together.
And this will be a big bang
transforming over the coming decade
the European financial services industry,
bringing together data and finance in a way
that has never been seen before in the context
of the EU single financial market.

#### Module 5 Data & TechFin   Industry Showcase: PSD2: Open Banking API for Startups   Industry Showcase: PSD2: Open Banking API for Startups (Gini)

For decades, FinTech startups
have been developing useful apps
and products to supplement normal banking products,
and also give consumers more control and insight
into their own finances.
However, banks have never been keen on sharing data,
so FinTech companies have had
to spend considerable resources
to develop workarounds to get the data.
One of the main ways they have done this
is through screen scraping.
Screen scraping is the act of developing a programme
to crawl through a website
and copy the information into another database.
This is commonly found in search engines like Google,
which send crawlers through the internet
to develop their search engine database.
This year the European Union
implemented Revised Directive
on Payment Services aka PSD2
which included regulations to promote the development
and use of online and mobile payments
such as open banking.
Other countries are following suit,
and in Asia, both Hong Kong and Singapore,
as well as other countries
are exploring opening banking APIs.
Opening banking APIs would facilitate
the growth of FinTech companies
and also give consumers greater choice
and opportunities in managing their financial lives.

#### Module 5 Data & TechFin   Industry Showcase: Methods of Data Protection: GDPR Compliance and Personal Privacy (Exate Technology)  Industry Showcase: Methods of Data Protection: GDPR Compliance and Personal Privacy (Exate Technology)

Hello, my name is Jonathan Naismith
and I am the Business Manager for Exate Technology,
a RegTech firm specialising in
data protection and data privacy,
enabling regulatory compliance
with the EU General Data Protection Regulation
as well as Cross-Border Data Transfers.
The recent data breaches at firms
such as Equifax, Uber and Facebook's breach of privacy
have led many to question the ability of firms
to protect sensitive client data.
Sadly, these recent breaches
have become more of a trend than a phenomenon
as they are increasingly common.
So, why is this the case?
To date, data protection has typically been done
on an application by application level
and each application is protected by an IT developer.
The common problems with this
are your IT developers are often contractors,
and thus probably work somewhere else now
and they view the task of protecting those applications
as boring and time consuming.
With new computing viruses being created daily
and the introduction of
quantum computing nearly upon us,
traditional data protection has become outdated
and needs to be addressed now.
At Exate, we encrypt or tokenise the data
on an attribute by attribute level at rest,
in transit, and in memory as required under GDPR.
This then allows an organisation
to separate application security from data security.
The question now becomes,
"How does one view the data if it is always encrypted?"
Exate ensure that data is seen strictly
on a need to know basis for
that specific individual, team, department or firm
to fulfil their role.
We achieve this by providing
your data with a virtual visa.
This is done by wrapping metadata or rules
around each individual data attribute
and allowing those attributes
to flow throughout the organisation with those rules.
Exate then just sit outside a firm's applications
and acts as an automated border control for your data.
To explain, imagine you have flown into an airport.
If you are a local resident,
you go down the fast track,
that is your public data, it doesn't need to be protected
it just flows throughout your organisation.
Now your tourists,
they have to go to the man in the booth
who checks their passports and looks at their visa
before deciding whether or not
they can enter the country,
we do the exact same thing for your data.
So just before the data enters an application
we look at the rules around each attribute
and match that back to the individual
who's trying to access the data.
Now one of two things can happen.
One, the individual passed the rule check
in which the data will decrypt, or two,
if the individual fails even one of the rule checks,
the data will remain encrypted
and their access blocked.
Exate then provides clients
with immutable forensic proof
of who accessed, or attempted to access what data.
In addition, Exate are able to provide customizable
user reports on your data,
in short, data about your data.
Lastly, Exate Technology has
no access to your clients' data,
their decryption keys or their applications
and requires no code changes to integrate
with any web-based application.
It is important to note
the same technology can be used for
Cross-Border Data Transfers.
I hope this has been of interest to you
and I would like to thank Hong Kong University
for allowing Exate to share this with you.

#### Module 5 Data & TechFin   5.5 Digital Identity   Video 5.5 Digital Identity
