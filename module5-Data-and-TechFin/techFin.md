Welcome back to the HKU FinTech course.
You are now in module 5,
and we'll be talking about data.
As you may know, data is the new oil,
and what this means is that it becomes
an increasingly valuable commodity both for you
as individuals, financial institutions,
or technology companies.
In this module, we will be covering
each of these aspects.
First, we're going to be talking to you as an individual.
How is GDPR in Europe
covering and impacting businesses
as well as you as an individual?
What about digital identity?

How a piece of password can now be condensed
in a piece of data,
and how that piece of data
can better define who you are,
and therefore customise experiences around you.
We'll then be also looking
at the financial services industry.
They have been using data since the 1970s,
and have been able to deliver new financial products
on the back of this.
However, there is challenge on doing so at scale.
Startups and the FinTech transformation
is also one which is underlied by the use
of technology and data accessibility
both by technology companies
as well as the financial institutions.
On the technology company side,
we'll be talking about the challenges
brought by TechFin companies,
as well as the governments of AI.
And finally, regulators.
The increased value of data means
that more and more people want to
access it by legal and illegal means.
And therefore, the regulation of data
from a data privacy perspective,
or the protection of data
from a technological perspective,
will also be addressed in this module.
