#### Module 6 The Future of Data-Driven Finance   6.1 Module 6 Introduction   Video 6.1 Module 6 Introduction


In the previous lessons,
you have had a good overview
of the history of FinTech
and different aspects of it,
from payments to data and identity.
In this chapter,
we will look at specific case studies
that will illustrate the concepts you have learned before
and show how FinTech
is being implemented around the world.
I have chosen five very different examples:
an early stage FinTech startup in Europe,
a late stage startup in the U.S,
a bank in South East Asia,
an e-commerce company in China,
and an infrastructure system in India.
These five examples are respectively
Revolut, Credit Karma, DBS, Alibaba and Aadhaar.
For each of these examples,
you could easily spend days looking at
their business models,
technology, value proposition or growth story.
I will share with you the lessons
I find the most interesting,
but do not hesitate to read about these companies,
research similar models
and further your education.
Let's now start
and I hope you will enjoy the lessons.
Thank you very much.

#### Module 6 The Future of Data-Driven Finance   6.2 Case Study 1: Revolut   Video 6.2 Case Study 1: Revolut


Welcome to this module where we'll be discussing
the case study of Revolut.
Revolut is a very interesting company
for many reasons.
First, it is a great illustration of the process
of unbundling and re-bundling of finance.
Secondly, it is a great example of
faster product development in finance.
And last but not least,
it is a FinTech startup
that has real consumer adoption.
Revolut links into many of the chapters
that you studied previously,
from the rise of the startups
to mobile money,
but also the evolution of payments
as well as cryptocurrencies and exchanges.
Revolut is a company
that was created in the UK in 2015,
and was founded by Nikolai Storonski,
who's a former trader at Credit Suisse,
and Vlad Yatsenko,
the CTO who was previously at Deutsche Bank.
When Revolut started a few years ago,
their value proposition was
to offer a free debit card
to those who were travelling,
and didn't want to pay the high fees
they were charged when they were going abroad.
In practical terms, what does it mean?
Consumers would download an app
to their mobile phones,
they would create an account,
and get onboarded through the phone.
And a few days later,
they would receive a debit card at home.
This was a prepaid debit card,
meaning that consumers would have to
transfer money into that card,
either from their bank account,
or from another card.
Once the money was deposited in the card,
consumers could use it
like a normal debit card,
with the difference that
any foreign transactions were free.
That was their initial value proposition.
Very quickly,
as the number of consumers grew,
Revolut also grew its product offering.
In addition to the free account,
they offered a Premium Account
for example, that offered benefits
like medical insurance.
Then they offered lending,
where consumers could apply for loans
directly from their phones.
And now also insurance,
such as phone insurance
or travel insurance,
where the they can detect when you're abroad
through your phone
and only charge for these days.
Very recently,
Revolut also started to offer cryptocurrencies
where I as a consumer can
directly buy cryptocurrencies from my app.
Today, Revolut has passed 1 million users.
They have raised more than $80 million,
which is a very good number considering
that they are quite lean,
and do not need to spend that much money
for customer acquisition.
From starting in the UK,
they are now available
in the rest of Europe,
and will certainly be looking at expansion
perhaps in the US or in Asia.
What are the takeaways
that we can learn from a company such as Revolut?
Revolut started on a very narrow product,
from debit card for those who didn't want to pay
foreign exchange fees,
and now they offer
insurance, cryptocurrencies, business accounts
for small businesses for example.
And finally, they will also apply for a bank licence,
in other words,
they are also becoming a challenger bank.
There are different types of
innovation models in finance,
and Revolut is a very good illustration
of what we call the unbundling
and re-bundling of finance.
In other words,
startups start on a niche product,
the unbundling part,
and end up offering
a very wide range of financial products,
the re-bundling part.
The case study also shows
the pace of consumer adoption in FinTech.
If Revolut were a bank, for example,
they would be the fastest growing bank in the UK.
And they would also be the only bank
to offer cryptocurrencies, for example.
And finally,
watch companies like Revolut very carefully,
because of their agility
and product development process.
Their ability to launch new products very quickly
is something which is quite different
actually from traditional finance,
but very similar to what we see from
internet companies or tech companies.
Now that you have learnt more about Revolut,
why not do a small exercise?
You could for example try to find similar examples
of FinTech companies that are unbundling
and re-bundling finance,
and compare them to Revolut.
Thanks a lot for following this module,
and I hope you found it insightful.
Thank you very much.

#### Module 6 The Future of Data-Driven Finance   6.3 Case Study 2: Alibaba   Video 6.3 Case Study 2: Alibaba

Welcome.
In this session,
we will look at the case study of Alibaba.
Alibaba has already been
mentioned several times in the course, for example,
in the modules about mobile money,
evolution of payments,
and also alternative finance.
I wanted to spend some time with you
on Alibaba
because it is a very important illustration
of the changing landscape in finance,
and how in certain markets,
new entrants are quickly
taking market share
from traditional financial institutions.
The financial arm of Alibaba
started in 2004 with Alipay,
to facilitate payments for users of Taobao.
Alibaba's Business-to-Consumers platform.
If we go back in history,
in 2002 eBay acquired PayPal
with the objective to integrate payment
into its auction platform,
and facilitate transactions for its users.
The creation of Alipay by Alibaba
followed a very similar objective,
and one of its first features
were an escrow service,
where the money was not paid to the seller
until the goods were received.
Alipay started as a payment mechanism for Taobao,
but very quickly
grew to offer more and more services,
from payment of utilities to money transfer.
In 2009, Alipay launched mobile payments,
and this has become
one of the most well-known successes of Alibaba.
In practise,
why is Alipay so different from other services?
If you think of PayPal
as a payment mechanism,
Alipay in its first version
was very similar to PayPal.
If you think of Apple Pay or Samsung Pay,
we could say that
Alipay in 2010 was very similar
to those mobile payment services
where you can pay from your smart phone.
But the biggest difference
is that from the Alipay app,
a consumer has access to all the services
that a financial institution can offer,
from payment to investment,
from insurance to money transfer.
In other words,
Alibaba built a digital bank from scratch
and put it directly in the smartphone
of its clients.
Today, the financial arm of Alibaba
is Ant Financial,
and although we think of Alibaba
as an e-commerce company,
Ant Financial is really
a diversified financial services institution.
It includes Alipay,
which Alibaba calls a lifestyle enabler,
and which I would call
the ultimate bank in a phone,
where consumers can make payments,
buy movie tickets,
invest money.
And not just online,
but also in physical shops.
Today Alipay has 500 million clients.
A second pillar of Ant Financial
is Ant Fortune,
the asset management arm
that includes Yu'e Bao,
which is today, the largest money market fund,
or one of the largest money market funds in the world
with more than $100 billion under management.
Another activity of Ant Financial
is Sesame Credit,
which is a credit rating agency,
and that takes a very large amount of data
including social data to score individuals.
In terms of numbers,
Ant Financial has become
one of the largest financial institutions in the world,
with half a billion clients in China,
but is also very significantly expanding
in other countries.
For example,
they are an investor in Paytm,
the largest mobile payment platform in India,
or Ascend in Thailand
and Kakao Pay in Korea.
What can we learn from Alibaba?
Alibaba is so massive
that we could take it as an exception,
but I think that it would be a mistake.
There is much to learn from Alibaba
in terms of innovation model,
and that could be replicated
in a lot of other situations.
For example,
what started as a mobile payment feature
of an e-commerce platform has become
a massive financial institution.
In other words, we are seeing
new entrants getting into finance,
and reaching scale very quickly,
thanks to their existing customer base,
and a big leverage on technology.
The example of Alibaba might be exceptional,
but it is clearly not unique,
and there will be more and more
e-commerce companies and technology companies
trying to offer financial products.
The other takeaway
is the rise of emerging markets in financial services.
In some ways,
the basic financial infrastructure in emerging markets
is an opportunity
for entrepreneurs and companies
to build financial services from scratch,
and to use the latest technologies,
what we call leapfrogging.
We are therefore likely to see
very different types of FinTech development
in the West
and developing countries.
Although Alibaba is exceptional in its scale,
there are more tech companies
getting into finance.
Have a look,
and you will see that there are more and more
in a lot of different countries in the world.
Thank you very much for following,
and I hope you won't forget
that new entrants are coming into finance.
Thank you.
