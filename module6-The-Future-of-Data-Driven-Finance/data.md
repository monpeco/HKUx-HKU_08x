#### Module 6 The Future of Data-Driven Finance   6.1 Module 6 Introduction   Video 6.1 Module 6 Introduction


In the previous lessons,
you have had a good overview
of the history of FinTech
and different aspects of it,
from payments to data and identity.
In this chapter,
we will look at specific case studies
that will illustrate the concepts you have learned before
and show how FinTech
is being implemented around the world.
I have chosen five very different examples:
an early stage FinTech startup in Europe,
a late stage startup in the U.S,
a bank in South East Asia,
an e-commerce company in China,
and an infrastructure system in India.
These five examples are respectively
Revolut, Credit Karma, DBS, Alibaba and Aadhaar.
For each of these examples,
you could easily spend days looking at
their business models,
technology, value proposition or growth story.
I will share with you the lessons
I find the most interesting,
but do not hesitate to read about these companies,
research similar models
and further your education.
Let's now start
and I hope you will enjoy the lessons.
Thank you very much.
