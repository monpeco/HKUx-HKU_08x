#### Module 4 FinTech Regulation and RegTech   4.1 Module 4 Introduction   Video 4.1 Module 4 Introduction


In Module 4, we turn to regulation of FinTech,
and a new development,
what is called RegTech or regulatory technology,
and if we look at this module,
we're going to begin by looking at
why do we regulate financial markets
before turning to the particular challenges
of regulating FinTech.
From there we'll move on
to what we think is one of the most exciting areas
of interaction between finance technology
and regulation, and that is RegTech.
We'll look at the RegTech ecosystem
and also ideas of smart regulation
and the outlook for future design of financial systems.

#### Module 4 FinTech Regulation and RegTech   4.1 Module 4 Introduction   Module 4 Learning Objectives

Module 4 addresses the range of regulatory considerations and approaches in the context of FinTech. It highlights the core regulatory objectives and the relationship between the post-2008 financial regulatory reform process and FinTech. It focuses in particular on the concept of RegTech - "regulatory technology" - and the RegTech ecosystem comprising financial institutions, startups, and regulators, and introduces "Smart Regulation" as the redesigning financial infrastructure and regulatory systems on the basis of new technologies, including Big Data, cloud, AI and blockchain.

In Module 4, learners will:

* Understand major financial policy and regulatory objectives and their implications for FinTech.
* Explore RegTech and the RegTech ecosystem, in order to understand one of the key trends in financial and regulatory transformation.
* Consider how regulatory systems and financial infrastructure could be redesigned on the basis of new technologies to deliver better results both from the standpoint of efficiency as well as resilience
* Think about new regulatory approaches such as regulatory sandboxes, India Stack and Smart Regulation

The first question is really
why do we regulate financial markets in the first place?
In fact,
even why do we regulate financial markets at all?
And as we've seen
with fintech's evolution generally,
the 2008 global financial crisis
was a game changer
for financial regulation.
Prior to the 2008 global financial crisis,
there was a general consensus
in favour of largely market-based approaches
to financial market regulation.
Many of these derived from
the ideas of what is called
the **efficient markets hypothesis**.

The idea of the efficient markets hypothesis
is that markets will price in
all available information
with prices of financial assets
providing for efficient allocation
of financial resources.
The idea is that market mechanisms provided
there is sufficient information
available to markets
will function to
both price, financial assets,
as well as, allocate financial resources
to their most valuable uses.
That idea was based on
a number of assumptions.

* First, that there is perfect information available in markets,
* second, that there are no transaction costs in markets
* third, that there is perfect competition in markets,
* and fourth, that there were rational market participants.

All of these ideas together
would lead towards
efficiently functioning financial markets
which would properly
support the functioning
of the overall economy.

The problem was that
certainly even prior to 2008,
we already knew that
information was not perfect,
that there are transaction costs
in acquiring information
or enforcing transactions in markets,
and that competition
is by no means perfect.
And much of law and regulation
prior to the global financial crisis
focused on improving information quality,
on enhancing competition,
on reducing transaction costs
to reduce what are called **market failures**.

The idea is that law and regulation
would be used
to reduce problems in markets
to help those markets
function in a better way.
2008 global financial crisis
fundamentally changed the way
that we think about
finance and its regulation.
In particular, the 2008 global crisis
and the hundreds of billions of dollars spent
on bailing out large banks around the world
highlighted a problem
which is called **systemic risk**.

Systemic risk is the risk that
the collapse of an individual financial institution
will cause the collapse of
the entire financial system,
which will in turn
cause the collapse of the economy.
This is exactly what we saw in 1929
and the 1930s Great Depression.
It's also what we saw in 2008.
As a result, since 2008,
there has been a massive amount of attention
on building new regulatory frameworks
to prevent financial crises,
to build confidence,
and to make markets function properly.

So, if we think of regulation today,
its function continues to be on 
* improving market functioning and efficiency.
* preventing systemic risks,
* maintaining financial stability,
* and importantly, fairness to market participants.
