#### Module 4 FinTech Regulation and RegTech   4.1 Module 4 Introduction   Video 4.1 Module 4 Introduction


In Module 4, we turn to regulation of FinTech,
and a new development,
what is called RegTech or regulatory technology,
and if we look at this module,
we're going to begin by looking at
why do we regulate financial markets
before turning to the particular challenges
of regulating FinTech.
From there we'll move on
to what we think is one of the most exciting areas
of interaction between finance technology
and regulation, and that is RegTech.
We'll look at the RegTech ecosystem
and also ideas of smart regulation
and the outlook for future design of financial systems.

#### Module 4 FinTech Regulation and RegTech   4.1 Module 4 Introduction   Module 4 Learning Objectives

Module 4 addresses the range of regulatory considerations and approaches in the context of FinTech. It highlights the core regulatory objectives and the relationship between the post-2008 financial regulatory reform process and FinTech. It focuses in particular on the concept of RegTech - "regulatory technology" - and the RegTech ecosystem comprising financial institutions, startups, and regulators, and introduces "Smart Regulation" as the redesigning financial infrastructure and regulatory systems on the basis of new technologies, including Big Data, cloud, AI and blockchain.

In Module 4, learners will:

* Understand major financial policy and regulatory objectives and their implications for FinTech.
* Explore RegTech and the RegTech ecosystem, in order to understand one of the key trends in financial and regulatory transformation.
* Consider how regulatory systems and financial infrastructure could be redesigned on the basis of new technologies to deliver better results both from the standpoint of efficiency as well as resilience
* Think about new regulatory approaches such as regulatory sandboxes, India Stack and Smart Regulation

#### Module 4 FinTech Regulation and RegTech   4.2 FinTech Regulation (Parts 1 & 2)   Video 4.2A FinTech Regulation (Part 1)


The first question is really
why do we regulate financial markets in the first place?
In fact,
even why do we regulate financial markets at all?
And as we've seen
with fintech's evolution generally,
the 2008 global financial crisis
was a game changer
for financial regulation.
Prior to the 2008 global financial crisis,
there was a general consensus
in favour of largely market-based approaches
to financial market regulation.
Many of these derived from
the ideas of what is called
the **efficient markets hypothesis**.

The idea of the efficient markets hypothesis
is that markets will price in
all available information
with prices of financial assets
providing for efficient allocation
of financial resources.
The idea is that market mechanisms provided
there is sufficient information
available to markets
will function to
both price, financial assets,
as well as, allocate financial resources
to their most valuable uses.
That idea was based on
a number of assumptions.

* First, that there is perfect information available in markets,
* second, that there are no transaction costs in markets
* third, that there is perfect competition in markets,
* and fourth, that there were rational market participants.

All of these ideas together
would lead towards
efficiently functioning financial markets
which would properly
support the functioning
of the overall economy.

The problem was that
certainly even prior to 2008,
we already knew that
information was not perfect,
that there are transaction costs
in acquiring information
or enforcing transactions in markets,
and that competition
is by no means perfect.
And much of law and regulation
prior to the global financial crisis
focused on improving information quality,
on enhancing competition,
on reducing transaction costs
to reduce what are called **market failures**.

The idea is that law and regulation
would be used
to reduce problems in markets
to help those markets
function in a better way.
2008 global financial crisis
fundamentally changed the way
that we think about
finance and its regulation.
In particular, the 2008 global crisis
and the hundreds of billions of dollars spent
on bailing out large banks around the world
highlighted a problem
which is called **systemic risk**.

Systemic risk is the risk that
the collapse of an individual financial institution
will cause the collapse of
the entire financial system,
which will in turn
cause the collapse of the economy.
This is exactly what we saw in 1929
and the 1930s Great Depression.
It's also what we saw in 2008.
As a result, since 2008,
there has been a massive amount of attention
on building new regulatory frameworks
to prevent financial crises,
to build confidence,
and to make markets function properly.

So, if we think of regulation today,
its function continues to be on 
* improving market functioning and efficiency.
* preventing systemic risks,
* maintaining financial stability,
* and importantly, fairness to market participants.

1. Doing nothing
2. Contact point
3. Sandboxes
4. New regulatory frameworks
5. Entirely new regulatory approaches

As we just discussed,
the 2008 financial crisis was a game changer
in the way that we look at
regulation of financial markets.
And for the eight or so years after 2008,
policy makers globally,
as well as, regulators around the world
spent much of their time and efforts
on developing new regulatory systems
to prevent the sorts of crisis
that we saw in 2008,
but this 2008 crisis
also triggered an explosion
in the development of fintech.
And that explosion
in the development of fintech
has been a major challenge for regulators,
after all, one element of fintech
is the idea of
disrupting traditional institutions,
traditional industries,
traditional finance,
but a major object of financial regulation
after the 2008 crisis
has been preventing disruption
in financial markets,
financial institutions,
and the financial system.

The same time,
there has been a strong focus on regulation
to support innovation and development
in the financial system,
and so regulators have been forced to
come to terms with the explosion
in new technologies and new participants
in the financial sector,
and to come to grips with
how to regulate the opportunities
as well as, the challenges.
And so far what we have seen
are four major approaches
amongst regulators.
The first approach has largely been
one of doing nothing,
in many ways,
this idea of doing nothing
can be seen as
either a positive or a negative approach.
It can be either permissive or restrictive.

China, prior to the middle of 2015
is usually seen as the major example
of a country taking a permissive approach
through deciding
not to put in place new regulations.
And in many ways,
it was this decision,
which has allowed the explosion of fintech
in the context of China.
But, as we've seen before,
that explosion of fintech in China
also brought with it new risks.
The evolution from
too small to care to too big to fail,
that we've seen
in the context of payments,
money market,
mutual funds,
and other areas.

As a result, even in the context of China,
the decision over the past several years
since 2015 has been increasingly to build
a new regulatory framework
for digital financial services.
Other jurisdictions
have taken an approach
of not doing anything,
which has largely been restrictive,
requiring new entrants into financial services
with new business models,
new technologies,
and new approaches
to comply with existing regulatory requirements,
which would typically develop
for a very different type of
established financial institution,
banks,
insurance companies,
mutual funds,
and the like.

The end result of this is
often a very restrictive approach.
Coming into the past several years,
regulators have been trying
to balance the objectives
of innovation and growth
with considerations of financial stability
and consumer protection,
and as a result,
they are developing an increasing number
of experimentation-based approaches.
Some involve regulators
establishing contact points
to meet with new entrants,
to learn about technologies
in order to be able to
develop appropriate regulatory responses.
Others have developed
what are called sandboxes,
these are areas for experimentation
in a limited market context
with limited regulation,
in order for both the new company
as well as the regulator,
to learn how best to move forward.
And finally,
an increasing number of jurisdictions
developing new regulatory frameworks,
particularly for the sorts of things
that we've seen in Modules 2 and 3.
Things like P2P lending or
alternative payment systems
or forms of crowdfunding.
But jurisdictions like China, India and others
are also looking at
developing entirely new regulatory approaches.

#### Module 4 FinTech Regulation and RegTech   4.3 Evolution of RegTech   Video 4.3 Evolution of RegTech

The 2008 financial crisis
was one of the key triggers
for the massive acceleration
in the development of FinTech worldwide.
But in addition,
it was the catalyst for the development of
RegTech, or regulatory technology.
And the ideas of RegTech relate to FinTech
but are much more broader.
In other words,
RegTech is the idea of using technology
for:
* regulatory compliance,
* regulatory monitoring,
* but also, regulatory design.

It is the idea of using technology
to make financial markets
and their regulation more effective.

Now, if we think of RegTech in that way,
the key aspect is that
it is beyond FinTech.
RegTech can apply
in any segment of the economy,
not just in the context of financial regulation.
One can imagine
the application of technology
to:
* environmental regulation,
* or traffic regulation,
* or airline regulation.

Any area of the economy with regulation,
the application of technology
offers the potential
to transform the effectiveness
of that particular regulatory system.

However, in the context of finance,
RegTech is so far,
the most developed.
In particular, we see RegTech
across **traditional financial institutions**,
across **new startups**,
and also across **regulators**, themselves.
And the global financial crisis
really made this a necessity.

Since 2008,
we have seen an absolute explosion
in new regulations around the world.
New regulations are released
by a major jurisdiction
approximately once every hour.
The end result is that,
every year,
thousands of new regulations come out.
And, for a financial institution
doing business on a cross-boarder basis,
this is one of the most complex influences
on their operations
as well as on their profitability
because, not only is regulation a challenge,
but it is also a cost.
As a result,
the global financial crisis
and its explosion of regulation
has driven the established financial industry
into applying technology
to address their compliance burdens
and their compliance costs.

At the same time,
we have seen an explosion
in new startups, new firms,
which are offering technologies
to help both startups
as well as traditional financial institutions
and even regulators
to better address
their regulatory and compliance burdens.
Finally, regulators themselves
are increasingly using technology
for a range of purposes
not only to do a better job
in their regulatory functions,
but also to increase market efficiencies
and reduce cost in the industry.

#### Module 4 FinTech Regulation and RegTech   4.4 RegTech Ecosystem: Financial Institutions   Video 4.4 RegTech Eco-system: Financial Institutions

The RegTech ecosystem encompasses
both industry and regulators.
It encompasses
the traditional incumbent financial institutions
like banks,
insurance companies,
and investment banks.
It also encompasses startups
of an increasing range
and it also encompasses regulators.
However, most of the development
that we've seen in the area
of RegTech over the past decade
following the global financial crisis
has been focused
in the traditional financial services industry,
in particular, in the banking industry.
And we can see this obviously simply
from the cost of regulation.
Not only have we had thousands of
new regulations in the US,
in Europe,
in Hong Kong,
in Singapore,
and Australia,
in economies all over the world
as a result of the global financial crisis.
But large financial institutions around the world
have paid to date over $300 billion US dollars
in fines for regulatory failures
both resulting from and also in the aftermath
of the global financial crisis.

Compliance has become a major challenge
from the standpoint of the industry
both from the standpoint of
simply keeping up with regulatory changes
and their implications,
but also from the standpoint of
the very, very large fines
that we have seen
coming out of major regulators
since the global financial crisis.
And if we look today at
traditional financial institutions,
if we look at RegTech in banks,
probably two areas highlight best
the necessity of technology.

First, are what are called
**know your customer requirements**.
Know your customer requirements
are something that every financial institution
everywhere in the world must comply with.
The origin of
know your customer requirements
comes from a series of regulations
that focus on preventing criminal use
of the financial system,
in particular,
things such a money laundering
or the financing of terrorism.
Internationally, we have an organisation
which is called the **FATF**.
The FATF is the **Financial Action Task Force**
on Money Laundering
and it establishes
internationally agreed minimum standards
for regulation in financial systems
with which every financial institution
around the world must comply.

Now, the challenge is that
these are simply agreements.
They then have to be implemented
into the individual regulatory systems
of jurisdictions of countries around the world.
The end result is that the **AML**,
**Anti-Money Laundering** requirements,
the KYC, Know Your Customer requirements
in the United States,
or Europe,
or Singapore,
or Hong Kong,
or Japan,
Mainland China
are all very similar but not identical.

Now, if you are a large financial institution
which is doing business
across these major economies,
part of your regulatory requirements
are to comply with the requirements
for KYC and AML
in each jurisdiction in which you operate.
And the number of regulators,
particularly those in the United States
have put in place some very large fines,
multiple billions of US dollars
against large financial institutions
like HSBC,
Standard Chartered,
BNP Paribas
for failures to
properly have global systems
to know their customers
and prevent money laundering.

As a result,
financial institutions have had to
implement systems
whereby they can at a moment's notice
know:
* who all of their, in many cases, tens of millions of customers all over the world are,
* and where they've gotten their money,
* and whether they raise any risks of criminal use of the financial system or terrorist financing.

And the only way
the financial institutions
have been able to do this
is spending large amounts of money
on employing people
and building technological systems
to:
* standardise account opening processes
* and the various reporting requirements

that money laundering
and KYC regulations
around the world apply.
Another area that we'll see

is what is called **MiFID II**.
MiFID II is the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive
in the European Union.
And MiFID II requires transparency.
It requires disclosure of
massive amounts of information
in particular about financial institutions,
securities and derivatives trading activities.

A very good example,
Merrill Lynch in 2017 was fined
almost 45 million British pounds
for failing to report
almost 75 million transactions
over a two year period.
Now, that is
roughly 150,000 transactions a day
for every business day
over that two year period.
And the only way that
a financial institution
can possibly keep track of
that amount of trading activity is through
building automated compliance systems
to package and report
the information to regulators.
So, from the standpoint of regulators,
the incumbent financial industry,
particularly banks have so far been
a major driving force.

#### Module 4 FinTech Regulation and RegTech   4.5 RegTech Ecosystem: Startups   Video 4.5 RegTech Eco-system: Start-ups

Predicted to be one of the fastest growing sector
of 2018, the RegTech startup ecosystem
has grown rapidly to match that expectation.
Entrepreneurs are driven
by the US$100 billion market opportunity
that represent compliance spending.
This has created a market of over 300 startups
which is fueled by
cumulative US$100 billion of investments
by VCs since 2012.

To better understand the RegTech startup ecosystem,
let's start with some context.
* With the USA setting the tempo
of global regulatory changes
and characterised by a fragmentation
of supervisory bodies,
most of compliance spending will occur there.

* However, whilst the USA represents
a strong natural client,
the startup creation activity
is predominantly based in Europe.

* As for Asia, the region represents
1/3 of global compliance spending
but is underserved by home-grown RegTech startups.

The 2008 financial crisis
has represented a strong catalyst
for regulatory changes across the world.
The combination of fines, over 321 billion,
regulatory changes which have tripled
in the last three years
and post-crisis reform implementation
such as Dodd-Frank or Basel III
has forced banks to increase their operating costs
as a response to their new regulatory obligation.

To just give you a sense of scale,
a financial institution like JPMorgan has added
another 14,000 legal and compliance staff since 2012.
It is not unusual for banks
to have 20 to 30% of their employees
working in compliance-related function.
This means that a tier one universal bank
has more compliance officers and lawyers
than Facebook has total employees.

However, the numbers of recurring fines
occurring post-crisis is challenging
the effectiveness of simply adding up
human resources to meet compliance obligation.
Indeed, for each one dollar spent on compliance,
three are being spent on regulatory fine.
It seems that the compliance industry
has difficulty to learn from its mistake.
This is what RegTech startups
are trying to address.

A decade has passed since the crisis
and since then most regulatory changes
have been implemented.
Financial institution are therefore now starting
to look at how to automate compliance obligation
and decrease the added recurring cost
that has built up post crisis.

RegTech startups are answering these demands.
RegTech companies can be classified
in three broad categories.
Each time I will quickly illustrate them.

#### First, regulatory compliance.
Here we are going to find companies
that are learning about regulatory changes
and telling banks how this is going to impact
their business logic.

#### Second, risk management.
It's about identifying, for example,
conduct risk to prevent another Libor scandal.

#### Third, financial crime.
How can we understand the ultimate beneficiary
behind a shell company to avoid money laundering
or terrorism financing?
Within these three categories,
the vast majority of startups
are found in the regulatory compliance space.
This reflects the fact
that this represents a low hanging fruit for success
mainly because data is available,
it requires limited integration
and it has a lower risk factor
in case of error by a RegTech company.

Similarly to FinTech companies,
the majority of RegTech companies
are B2B providers selling to financial institutions.
Whilst demand from this client base is strong,
it appears that the sales cycle remains long.
On average, we're talking about 12 months.

Certain exceptions are noted
especially in the context of
upcoming regulatory deadline
such as MFID 2 or GDPR
which therefore fast track the sales cycles
and the procurement process.

Additionally, I would like to mention
that RegTech startups can also be found
in two other areas worth mentioning.
Firstly, **regulators**.
The B2G or business-to-government space is growing.
Regulators globally are engaging RegTech startups
via various channels from hackathons
to accelerators to find solution
to enhance the supervisory and regulatory function.
Similarly to financial institution,
regulators are driven by the cost benefit
provided by RegTech startups
that can reach a factor of up to 10 times.
These savings are actually especially important
when considering the fact that tax payers' money
is used to finance regulators
and their operating costs
making it a strong public policy case.
However, whilst having regulators as a client
brings a lot of legitimacy,
the lengthy procurement process
is extended by additional tendering rules
relative to sourcing supplies
from the public sector.

Secondly, **certain FinTech companies
are directly adding regulatory compliance process
into their product**.
For example, in the context
of wealth management space,
funds products are now being sold
and marketed only to pre-qualified investors
by leveraging on their data
to determine suitability, location and investment profile.
Whilst for consumers, this provides
a level of personalization of services;
for financial institutions,
this embeds regulatory compliance
into the sales process
and that's important
because it allows to avoid fines relative to mis-selling.
Previously what the financial crisis has highlighted
was that compliant and sales function
were operating in silos.
This overview concludes
the RegTech startups ecosystem of Module 4.
